 The U.S.S. Enterprise NCC 1701-D traveling at warp speed through space.
 on the gigantic new Enterprise NCC 1701-D.
 Huge, with a giant wall diagram showing the immensity of this Galaxy Class starship.
 Showing the details and size of this enormous starship.
 With its huge windows revealing the immense span of the Starship's outer surface.
 PICARD, TROI, and DATA seated in the command area. Starfleet LIEUTENANT WORF, a young Klingon, is at the
 As Picard turns to Data:
 All checking their consoles, puzzled at readings they're getting.
 Emphasizing the incredibly SHINING GRID which the Enterprise is approaching. Seeming impossibly large, yet in some ways as delicate as a spiderweb, it is composed of interlocking geometrical shapes.
 Data is looking up from his command position console, showing as much alarm as we'll ever see on his face.
 as "Q" (Elizabethan) makes a formal bow (of that same era) to Picard. At which the turbolift doors snap open and TWO SECURITY CREW members start to ENTER, led by Security and Weapons Officer NATASHA YAR. However, "Q" merely gives a nod in that direction and a miniature of the space grid outside APPEARS AT THE TURBOLIFT ENTRANCE, barring the security team's entrance and CLOSES THE TURBOLIFT DOORS. Then "Q" turns toward Picard.
 We will see Conn stealthily, carefully reaching to the small phaser on his belt.
 Interrupted by Conn drawing his phaser. But "Q" barely nods toward Conn at which a FLUTTERING ELECTRIC BLUE WAVE envelopes that bridge crewman, and we HEAR THE BRIEF BEGINNINGS OF A SCREAM as Conn falls with the SOUND of a frozen hard object striking the deck. Picard comes to his feet, ignoring "Q" as:
 Who is clearly very angry as he kneels at the prone form of Conn who appears to have been instantly frozen solid. Troi hurries INTO SHOT kneeling too. There is even white evaporation vapor rising up from the body.
 Appropriate THEME MUSIC with spaceship hanging motionless, still facing the mysterious SHIMMERING GRID that stretches in front of it from galaxy horizon to horizon.
 In the b.g. on a floating stretcher Conn is being taken to the turbolift, advanced medical emergency aids are attached to his body.
 Ignoring the previous, intent instead on inspecting his Elizabethan costume as Picard comes up to him.
 The "Q" visitor moves a hand again to create THE SAME SOUNDS and the SAME BLINDING FLASH, producing the same human image but this time unshaven and with an UGLY AUTOMATION LOOK AND IN THE UNIFORM OF A MILITARY OFFICER FROM THE MID 21st CENTURY WARS. Q's voice sounds a bit drugged now as he eyes his new costume.
 As Worf gets a message and turns toward Picard.
 It takes a moment to accept the fact "Q" is really gone then Worf turns to Picard.
 Turning to Troi:
 Clearly he has to come up with something. He reflects for a moment more, then makes up his mind, turns to Troi.
 Picard waits until all are turned toward him.
 As he takes us into WIDE CAMERA ANGLE, aiming both for a feeling of the starship's huge size and enormous power.
 Worf nodding at a reading which an Engineer shows him, then EXITING to return to the bridge. Meanwhile, engineering personnel work at their controls and a LOW PITCHED WHINE quickly works itself up into a DEAFENING HIGH PITCHED SHRIEK while ENERGY DISPLAYS APPEAR AT MAIN ENGINE CONNECTIONS.
 Showing both the Enterprise and the mysterious grid.
 Worf enters bridge from turbolift, crossing to his position.
 Suddenly into maximum warp, the energy release momentarily DISTORTING BOTH THE ALIEN GRID AND THE STARS IN SIGHT AROUND IT. When the EFFECT is over, the starship has turned, seeming to almost brush against the mysterious grid, and is then racing away from it.
 With Enterprise in b.g. at warp speed, escaping. Then the 'grid' suddenly shrinks in size, growing brighter as it coalesces together INTO THE SHAPE OF A BRIGHTLY COLORED SPINNING SHAPE which now races after the Enterprise.
 The faces of the bridge crew reflect the fact that Enterprise is at very high warp speed and continuing to accelerate into even higher warp.
 VIEWER IMAGE SHIMMERS into reverse view, which is much the same as the forward view except for ONE BLINKING POINT OF LIGHT AT IMAGE CENTER.
 as needed.
 The entire bridge suddenly SHUDDERS HARD and it brings startled looks to the faces of some of the bridge crew. Then the motion eases.
 Still at high warp. We cannot see the image of the following "hostile" (which is not magnified in this ANGLE).
 As the turbolift doors snap open, Picard and the others ENTER the smaller, sparse and functional Battle Bridge.
 our vessel's stardrive, containing our Battle Bridge...
 Acquainting us with the smaller and more severe battle bridge, its configuration and positions. Picard is speaking the balance of his log entry to the microphone at his command position.
 The young Klingon at the Captain's command station now.
 Traveling through space for a moment, then photon torpedoes blasting out of the starship's aft tubes. The torpedo pattern disappears into the distance behind the vessel.
 All intent on what is happening as:
 As we see the largest of the assemblies begin to move, yawning open. Other mechanisms are doing their jobs too.... and THE MONOLITHIC STARSHIP DIVIDES INTO ITS TWO SECTIONS.... STARDRIVE AND SAUCER MOVING APART.
 On which we see a tiny but SOMEWHAT LARGER IMAGE OF THE HOSTILE VESSEL in front of which the last few PHOTON DETONATIONS HAPPEN AND FADE AWAY.
 Where the IMAGE OF THE HOSTILE is rapidly growing in size.
 As the HOSTILE IMAGE rushes down on the starship, THE COALESCENT SHAPE OPENING UP INTO SOMETHING LIKE THE SHIMMERING GRID WE'VE SEEN, but now as if to enclose (and perhaps crush) the starship. A FURY OF SOUNDS like CLANKING-SCREAMS OF METAL BEING STRESSED BEYOND ITS LIMITS.
 As the bridge and the entire Stardrive Section is SHAKEN ALMOST ANGRILY as the same CACOPHONY OF CLANKING-SCREAMS continues. All bridge crew cling to their seats until the SHAKING AND SOUNDS REACH A PEAK. As when "Q" first appeared, FLASHES OF LIGHT BLIND US and become:
 It is an immense courtroom meant to reflect strength and power. (We'll discover that it dates back to the mid-21st Century post-atomic crisis era.) Both decor and legal procedures reflect the time when a desperate humanity, still wounded and bleeding from nuclear war, sought answers to its pain and problems through the merciless strength of a new form of dictatorial government representing neither capitalism nor communism. Our four starship people are in old, ragged and stained uniforms which 'demean' them as criminals. In comparison with the gleaming steel and glass of the rest of the courtroom, the Prisoner's Dock at which our people sit is made of rough-hewn, hard and ugly wooden benches. Suddenly, our Starfleet group is CAUGHT IN A HARSH GLARING SPOTLIGHT. Data, looking around with great curiosity, is the first to speak:
 Important, the MANDARIN-BAILIFF is not a fun figure. Despite the Asian robe and accent, he is an important authority figure--and his expression and actions underscore this. He caries a slim, portable view screen, the face of which contains scrolled information he will occasionally refer to. Now, as he nods to a Court Functionary who uses an ancient, oriental bell, DOLEFULLY CLANGING to gain attention.
 Some still arriving, chattering in excitement, having to be intimidated into silence by a 21st CENTURY SOLDIER, heavily armed. Picard waves in a way indicating Data, Tasha and Troi should not stand.
 A 21st Century MILITARY OFFICER moving to our Starfleet group, leveling his automatic weapon toward them.
 The "judge's bench" (an appropriate 21st Century design on Chapman camera-crane) comes floating into the courtroom. Seated in it is "Q" (JUDGE), an arrangement which gives "his Honor" physical access to every part and corner of this courtroom. As he floats serenely over spectators' heads, suddenly there's the RATATATTAT of an automatic weapon.
 Just completing FIRING a warning burst at the feet of Picard.
 This is a court of the year 2049, by which time more 'rapid progress' had caused all 'United Earth' nonsense to be abolished.
 And "Q" (JUDGE) flies INTO SCENE, gesturing toward Tasha as he did earlier to Conn on the bridge... resulting in the same FLUTTERING ELECTRIC BLUE WAVE THAT ENVELOPES HER. As Tasha goes rigid, frozen, Data supports her, lowers her form gently to the floor as:
 bending over Tasha, then to "Q":
 Seems to be considering it. Then he looks downward, indicates.
 Action continuing from where it ended. The gun barrels are now pressing even closer to Troi and Data's heads as:
 The Soldiers CLICKING FIRING ACTION TO FULL COCK. "Q" turns to Picard.
 Taking a moment to consult his memory, then:
 as Data goes on.
 with "Q" nodding to him as the Bailiff stands, raising his voice.
 Spectators standing. Picard and his people coming to their feet too.
 as "Q" moves his bench into position.
 Picard and the others now in their normal garb and at their regular stations, all beginning to register their realization of where they now are.
 Reacting to where they now find themselves. Data turns to the Ops position.
 moving in on a yellowish ball of a planet glowing against the black backdrop of starry space in the reflected light of its sun. There is some cloud layer. At this distance, the planet's land masses are vague and indistinct.
 An older class starship (the USS Hood) lies in geosynchronous orbit above the planet.
 AN AERIAL VIEW of the small, obviously old Bandi city connected to the modern sprawling spaceport/station, both set in the middle of a harsh and forbidding landscape. This is Farpoint Station. CAMERA PUSHES IN on the Old City portion.
 the office of Farpoint Station's Administrator.
 Riker ENTERING, crossing to an elegant, unusually shaped desk where ZORN, the station Groppler (administrator) rises and (unused to handshaking) at first offers the wrong hand, then gets the procedure straightened out with MUMBLED APOLOGIES. As with all the Bandi, Zorn is tall, skinny, rather grey-looking -- appears to be sixtyish (as do all the Bandi, including the young ones.)
 Ah... ah yes, there was another selection here...
 In considerable contrast to Zorn's old city office we just left, this structure has a "starbase" look with its dazzling tritanium and glass construction. The few people in sight are Starfleet personnel. ENTERING FOREGROUND are DR. BEVERLY CRUSHER and her fifteen-year-old son WESLEY.
 Riker ENTERS SCENE behind them and hurries to catch up. He calls:
 The ANGLE suggests a covered, airy mall with flowers and trees -- many of them Earth types but with a scattering of alien vegetation too. It is a spacious walkway with a number of pleasant shops and booths. In b.g. we SEE Bandi natives of this world, a tall and greyish life form, quiet and overly polite. Beverly, Wesley and Riker move down a line of shops.
 as they walk, Wes continuing to eye the two adults. Then:
 as they walk away, Riker enjoying the look that's come onto her face over this incident.
 LT. GEORDI LaFORGE and ENSIGN SAWYER MARKHAM are in the small, comfortable lounge area. Markham is a likeable young man, enthusiastic, energetic. He is still inclined to shoot from the hip rather than consider before speaking, but he is a capable (and very new) graduate of the Academy. We SEE Geordi at first only from behind, and we may routinely register the fact he is black.
 The two young men turn around sharply to find Riker has come up behind them. The most important thing we notice about Geordi is that he wears a strange flattish device (like futuristic goggles) over his eyes. Although he is technically blind, his head always turns toward the person speaking to him because he can, in fact, see as well or better than anyone through the use of the visual prosthesis. As they realize that Riker is a senior officer, both young men straighten to attention.
 The Enterprise stardrive module in orbit of the Farpoint planet.
 As Riker BEAMS IN. Lieutenant Tasha Yar of Security is there, waiting until Riker is fully materialized, then:
 As Riker follows her inside, she speaks quietly toward the controls:
 He is seated in the command chair with Data and a couple of other crewpersons at their stations.
 as Tasha motions Riker to the seat, turns the VIEWER ON. The VIEWER SHOWS A SHOT FROM EARLIER WHEN "Q" (ELIZABETHAN) HAD APPEARED AND IS TALKING TO Picard. The VOICES ARE FAINT and Riker leans in, riveting attention to the bridge record.
 as the android officer turns toward the captain.
 Where VIEWER SHOWS ANGLE ON THE "Q" GRIDWORK STRETCHES OVER THE HEAVENS, THEN SHOT OF "Q" (21st CENTURY). Riker TURNS AWAY FROM VIEWER TOWARD CAMERA as he looks at the crewpersons on the bridge. He speaks to no one in particular.
 Picard at a viewer going over a rather complex screen of formulas. A KNOCK at the door, he turns the viewer off.
 As before, the Saucer Section is above and ahead of the battle section. The battle section is SLOWLY moving ahead toward the Saucer Section for link-up.
 Riker at the conn, concentrating. Tasha and Data are studying him, privately evaluating this new man.
 He's making a couple of calculations, glancing up at the viewscreen.
 The rear end of the saucer is moving closer, but it is still high.
 Two percent rise. Up angle adjustment three degrees. Maintain docking speed.
 The battle section is seen rising, angling forward slightly, still moving slowly toward the saucer.
 glancing at the O.S. viewscreen, works his console again.
 The two are level now, quite close together, the battle section still moving slowly forward.
 Riker looks up at the viewscreen again.
 The saucer looms in the viewscreen -- everything is level, the docking section is dead ahead -- we are still moving forward.
 He makes a couple of quick entries on his console.
 The two glide together smoothly.
 Riker hits a couple more tabs on his panel as:
 The reverse of disconnecting SHOTS we saw earlier -- huge STARDRIVE SECTION and SAUCER MODULE MECHANISMS MAKING FINAL HOOK-UP.
 The docking complete.
 Riker with Data, Tasha, and others. The time this takes is indicative of the size of this new Enterprise.
 As the turbolift arrives. Lt. Worf crosses toward it, intercepts Riker.
 Much larger and more comfortable than the small battle Ready Room we were in earlier. Picard is there, turning as he hears a KNOCK:
 as Riker steps out of the turbolift. He stops, takes in the size of his compared to the Battle Bridge. The Klingon Lieutenant is at the conn position. He turns, seeing Riker:
 But, sir, the transporter could have you on the Hood in a matter of seconds, Admiral.
 Both the Enterprise and the Hood in orbit close together. CAMERA ANGLE shows how much LARGER the Enterprise is.
 Beverly is wearing medical "blue" -- or whatever color Science personnel are going to be assigned. She steps toward a LARGE VIEWSCREEN which comes on, showing readouts indicative of the status of the ship's medical facilities.
 As Beverly turns to find Captain Picard ENTERING. She nods in answer to his question.
 As if they're appraising each other, then:
 As Beverly nods, waits for him to continue.
 Again, EMPHASIZING the considerable difference in the sizes of the two starships as we SEE that the USS Hood is PULLING AWAY, LEAVING ORBIT.
 He is standing before the huge viewscreen. Behind him is the young Klingon, Worf, at the conn position with the rest of the bridge stations only nominally manned. Set in geosynchronous orbit over the planet, the Enterprise requires minimal monitoring at this time.
 They OPEN, and Picard steps out onto the bridge.
 as Picard smiles and steps toward it.
 Sorry, sir...
 U.S.S. Enterprise in orbit of planet Cygnus IV.
 Minimum bridge crew on duty.
 Picard and Riker comparing notes.
 As Picard and Riker enter from the adjoining Ready Room. Troi is just arriving in the turbolift and Picard calls to her.
 He's obviously stunned to find her here, although she isn't at all surprised.
 Studying the two of them with some curiosity now.
 As she looks back toward Riker serenely.
 ESTABLISHING SHOT as:
 Where Zorn sits behind his desk, his posture and attitude indicating some nervousness. Seated facing him are Picard, Riker, and Troi. We see that Zorn's attention is on Troi.
 As her expression begins to indicate an awareness of something distressing, something painful. During which:
 This stumps Picard for a moment, during which:
 We Bandi do not wish to leave our home world. If Starfleet cannot accept that small weakness, then we will be forced, unhappily, to seek an alliance with someone like the Ferengi, or...
 As appropriate.
 The U.S.S. Enterprise still in orbit over Cygnus IV.
 Riker moving as if seeking someone. He intercepts a YOUNG ENSIGN who is passing and the junior officer sees Riker's emblem of rank and snaps to attention.
 As the Ensign steps to a black surface of the corridor wall.
 Moving off in the indicated direction. Then the black surface there comes alive with a FLASHING DIRECTION SIGNAL.
 The Parkland hidden at this moment by a WILD SECTION OF CORRIDOR WALL AND HATCHWAY which, when the hatch is opened, will REVEAL PARKLAND.
 As Riker ENTERS through it and stands inspecting the Parkland scene with genuine appreciation and then HEARS SOMEONE WHISTLING A MELODY, but doing it rather badly and laboriously.
 As he MOVES AWAY, seeking the source of the WHISTLING which will begin to grow LOUDER now.
 As Riker crosses, stepping from rock to rock. He makes a misstep, almost falls, then recovers and gets across. He looks back at the stone which caused it.
 As he walks, the WHISTLING is nearby now. He stops, calls:
 Riker ENTERS SHOT through shrubbery, sees something and stops.
 Lying there, cushioned by deep grass. He's totally absorbed in certain melody notes he's attempting -- and keeps missing.
 Moving onto TWO SHOT where he stops, and WHISTLES the same melody, hitting the correct notes. A startled Data looks up blankly, then comes quickly to his feet, but Riker waves him back down, sits beside him.
 We HEAR A VOICE (Wesley) and Riker gets to his feet, looks off in that direction.
 Data leading the way, then indicates.
 As he hurries toward where we can now SEE the holodeck wall (REAR PROJECTION SCREEN) on which we can now SEE that the PARKLAND soil, rocks and vegetation blend with the PROJECTED IMAGE there. Astonished, Riker backs away from this, squinting again.
 Where, of course, the wall blend is no longer visible.
 As the hatchway smoothly SLIDES OPEN AGAIN. Through it is REVEALED THE PARKLAND, through which Riker, Data and a very wet Wesley make their way to the HATCHWAY. As they MOVE THROUGH HATCHWAY, the bulkhead BEGINS CLOSING.
 The Captain walking with a Senior Officer when he sees Riker and the others. He motions the Senior Officer to continue on by himself, stops and waits.
 Wesley is wiping himself dry now. He is enthusiastically trying to explain his adventures.
 As he wipes, he's been turning something over in his mind.
 TO ESTABLISH our location.
 Which is made up of Riker, Data, Troi, Tasha and Geordi. There are a number of people in the mall area, some in identifiable Enterprise-type uniforms. The others are in various civilian clothes. They are taking in the Bandi shops, booths, food and drink offered by Bandi vendors.
 ON GEORDI as he looks around the area, moving slowly and carefully scanning. Then he shakes his head.
 Not at all what one would expect of a "service tunnel", if this is indeed that. These are smooth, rounded, glistening walls whose GLOW lights up the entire passageway. (We'll see something similar later on a mystery vessel). Tasha is activating her communicator.
 After a moment, the familiar TRANSPORTER SOUND BEGINS. Riker, Data, and Geordi BEAM IN, SOLIDIFY. Then Riker hurries over to Troi while Data and Geordi examine their surroundings with great curiosity.
 Riker helping her very tenderly:
 As before, in geosynchronous orbit.
 in the captain's chair. The bridge is nominally manned at this time. We will see Worf at the ops panel. Picard glances around as the SOUND OF THE TURBOLIFT DOORS OPENING COMES OVER, and he freezes.
 standing just inside the turbolift door. Beverly is uncomfortable; Wes is all eyes, taking in as much as he possibly can in this one limited look at his dream place. Beverly starts to step out, gesturing to Wes to stay in the turbolift.
 Children are not allowed on the bridge, Doctor.
 Wesley looks to Picard hopefully. Beverly waits, then Picard shrugs, tries to sound friendly.
 Instantly, the image of a ship is flashed on the screen. It appears big, dark, ominous -- even at far range -- and it is approaching very swiftly.
 Identification?
 staring at the viewscreen.
 The ship is closer now -- looks menacing -- and still coming fast.
 The Enterprise in orbit.
 All bridge positions are filled now, everyone watching the viewscreen intently.
 The mystery vessel approaching closer.
 Continue universal greeting on all frequencies. Get me Groppler Zorn.
 He is seated at the desk, speaks into a small portable communicator grid shaped to fit the palm of his hand.
 There are no ships scheduled to arrive until --
 The mystery vessel approaches and settles into geosynchronous orbit. It is positioned slightly above and to the side of the Enterprise -- and it is a great deal larger than the Enterprise. Suddenly, A GLOWING PULSE OF LIGHT throbs out from the mystery vessel toward the Enterprise.
 The LIGHT GLOWS OVER EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE ON THE BRIDGE. They are startled by it, but no one is hurt. As the GLOW FADES AWAY:
 Troi is leaning against the strange, smooth and shining tunnel wall as if still feeling pain. Riker, obviously still concerned for Troi, is examining the strange tunnel walls with the tricorder while Geordi moves his HEAR him trying to get a signal back from the Enterprise.
 On which is featured an IMAGE OF MYSTERY VESSEL.
 As another phaser-like BEAM STRIKES DOWN AT THE PLANET.
 Excitement.
 They're firing on Farpoint, sir... !
 Riker and his team racing to where the rounded, smooth and shining walls of the tunnel begin to give way to a more ordinary looking rectangular corridor of mixed stone and tile walls.
 Riker pulling to a halt in order to examine with curiosity the blend where the unknown type tunnel walls give way to stone and tile construction similar to what we've seen in the old Bandi city. Ahead is a stone block stairway leading up to that old city. Geordi has hurried in, peering closely at the more familiar kind of wall surface.
 Riker and Data begin climbing the stairway, leaving the CAMERA CENTERED ON TROI, TASHA AND GEORDI. Troi has already reached for her communicator control.
 OLD CITY IN IN B.G. where FIRE RAGES in a smashed structure in that part of the old city we can see. In CLOSER FOREGROUND is an entrance to the underground passageway, this entry guarded by thick, hand-worked metal door, locked. This village square is a connecting point between the Old City and Farpoint Station. A short distance in the OFF-CAMERA DIRECTION lies Farpoint Mall.
 We HEAR a hand phaser HUM as a GLOW FLICKERS OVER THE METAL DOORS which now spring open and a CLASHING OF METAL SOUND. Riker and Data ENTER SCENE though those door, phasers in hand.
 As Riker touches his communicator control.
 BLAST REFLECTS ON THEIR FACES and they whirl to see:
 Where a building is being BLASTED INTO STONES AND DUST.
 Filled with the dust and SOUNDS of a nearby BLAST. Zorn is working frantically with his communicator.
 On MAIN VIEWER THE IMAGE OF THE mystery vessel which as we watch will FIRE ANOTHER PHASER-LIKE BOLT DOWN TOWARD THE PLANET. The bridge crew are anxiously poised on the edge of their seats, waiting for Picard's next order.
 As the doors SNAP OPEN TO REVEAL TROI, TASHA, AND GEORDI who hurry onto the bridge, take their regular positions (Geordi relieving Ops). Meanwhile:
 No indication that Farpoint Station has been damaged at all. Riker, standing with Data, is using his communicator.
 As Riker whirls again in that direction, interrupting Picard:
 Everything as we last left it.
 Picard looks at the IMAGE of the huge mystery vessel still in orbit nearby. Picard turns to Troi:
 In b.g., Tasha touching panel controls.
 Rather than being nervous over the arrival of "Q" (JUDGE), Picard has become coldly angry.
 Also interesting, that order about phasers.
 But she's with a half dozen MEDICAL ASSISTANTS very busy preparing medical supplies, bringing portable medical equipment, etc.
 Picard turning back to "Q".
 Where we SEE the mystery vessel beginning to FIRE BLASTS down at the planet again.
 They are headed toward Zorn's office door when the BLUE BOLT HITS beside the door, flooding the scene with a FLASH OF BLUE LIGHT. The corridor rocks, and the ceiling comes down partially. Riker and Data are flung down by the explosion. A beat, and then Data stirs, sits up. Riker is slower, but is managing to haul himself upright.
 It is hanging by its hinges, and debris-dust is drifting out of it. Riker and Data move quickly to and through the open door.
 As Riker and Data ENTER. The office has been badly damaged, especially near the door. O.S. THE SOUND OF ANOTHER BOLT EXPLODING echoes. The room shakes under the impact. There is a MUFFLED SOB near the desk.
 Zorn is cowering under his elegant desk, shaking and sobbing in fear.
 A kind of TRANSPORTER SOUND is heard, and then a TRANSPORTER EFFECT, somewhat different from the Starfleet variety, centers on Zorn. He beging SCREAMING as he FADES FROM VIEW.
 As he keys his communicator.
 Question, sir, could it have been the "Q" character you met earlier.
 She's frowning, trying to 'feel' something.
 And the image of the mystery vessel.
 As he whirls suddenly on "Q".
 Amused at all this. He turns from Riker to look at Picard.
 Realizing "Q" is gone, turning to look at each other. Riker checks a reading on his panel.
 Riker's away team moving onto the transporter platform. With him are Data, Troi, and Tasha. They carry the usual away team equipment which they're now checking.
 TRANSPORTER SOUND, then the BEAMING EFFECT. Then, fully MATERIALIZED, Riker and the others look around to orient themselves.
 Enterprise and the mystery vessel still in orbit.
 Geordi and Worf at their positions. Picard is in the command seat, antsy.
 Still led and followed by the security people, they're now moving along fairly rapidly although this tunnel is narrower here. Otherwise, its look hasn't changed.
 Troi and the team arriving, standing puzzled at what seems to be only a sharp turn where we SEE a strange indentation in the tunnel wall there. Troi, intent on this, steps closer, pushes her body against the indentation.
 Riker sliding through the pliable opening in the tunnel wall, joining Troi who is standing there aghast at what is suspended in the center of this area.
 Zorn is held suspended off the deck in the center of a cylindrical forcefield. The force field edges GLITTER SOFTLY to outline the shape of it.
 As the other team members come through the 'wall' too, stand, reacting at the sight of Zorn.
 The FORCEFIELD SPARKLES, CLICKS, causing Zorn to writhe and twitch. He SCREAMS.
 They move forward toward him, and are brought up sharply by the leading edge of the force field. Data has already started to scan with his tricorder. Riker calls to Zorn.
 As Data and Riker raise their phasers toward Zorn.
 Where the wall seems to be "alive", undulating. Beyond it, Tasha is assisting Zorn to his feet, supporting him. Meanwhile, Troi looks around Zorn's "cell", sensing something troubling. Riker has turned on his communicator:
 The floor of the area suddenly going soft, away team members sinking into it while still ANOTHER SECTION OF WALL FOLDS ITSELF OVER TASHA. (What we're seeing is this part of the mystery "vessel" becoming a living thing.)
 Picard speaking anxiously toward his command panel as we HEAR Riker's MUFFLED SOUNDS OF DISTRESS.
 Toward which Lieutenant Worf is pointing. On it the IMAGE of the mystery vessel is BEGINNING TO CHANGE IN SHAPE. The firm, hard edges of the spaceship are giving way to something softer, very mysterious in nature.
 In which we SEE a familiar BLINDING FLASH and "Q" appears, now wearing the uniform of a STARFLEET CAPTAIN.
 He can't hear you, Captain.
 As the same strange transporter SOUND that accompanied Zorn's "kidnapping" is heard and the same STRANGE TRANSPORTER EFFECT APPEARS, this time MATERIALIZING FIVE IMAGES -- Riker, Data, Troi, Tasha, and Groppler Zorn.
 Very surprised, looking from his away team to "Q".
 On which the changed IMAGE of the mystery "vessel" seems to be floating in closer to the Enterprise.
 Where the vessel/creature IMAGE is SOFTENING FURTHER INTO AN AMORPHOUS, COLORFUL AND LOVELY SHAPE. Picard turns to the Groppler, demanding:
 in orbit, as a THICK, PALE BLUE ENERGY BEAM AIMS DOWNWARD.
 HIGH DOWNWARD SHOT SHOWING THE ENERGY BEAM terminating and being absorbed into Farpoint Station.
 Picard and others watching the energy beam terminating at Farpoint Station.
 The city/station miniature -- the Farpoint Station part of it GROWING SOFT, SHIMMERING, SLOWLY BECOMES A CREATURE OF GOSSAMER, FEATHERY LIGHTNESS -- now gracefully rising up from its captivity.
 Where what was once the "mystery vessel" but now an increasingly beautiful COLORFUL, FEATHERY TENDRIL SHAPE is descending closer and closer to what was once the Farpoint Station part of city/station (miniature).
 On which the two creatures are rising upward OUT OF IMAGE FRAME.
 As Picard turns on him.
 racing through space at warp speed.
 with the S.S. Tsiolkovsky in orbit. Then the Enterprise appears and moves in to join the research vessel.
 All regulars on duty -- Data at Ops, Geordi at Conn, Tasha and Worf upstage intent on main viewer which shows the Enterprise moving in parallel with the research vessel. First, a STATIC GARBLE, then a WOMAN'S VOICE over the audio channel, low and insinuating. INDISTINCT VOICES, LAUGHTER, IN B.G. indicate the SOUNDS OF A NOISY PARTY.
 The away team consists of RIKER, GEORDI, DATA, TASHA, and a SECURITY GUARD. Data and Geordi have tricorders; Tasha has the large phaser.
 The TRANSPORTER EFFECT COMES IN, FADES DOWN, leaving the away team materialized. The ship is very quiet -- a low HUM of working equipment, but without the murmur of living beings.
 This corridor shows signs of phaser char marks on the walls. There is litter on the deck -- food, a wine bottle, discarded clothes. Data records the scene with his tricorder, as:
 Narrow view of a small bridge (SET FRAGMENT), mostly consoles, maybe a command chair. And beyond these, the emergency hatch set in the bulkhead -- the hatch is gone, and the cold glitter of a starfield winks beyond it. (SET DRESSING NOTE: There should be no loose objects visible, only items that are firmly anchored to deck or bulkhead. Anything loose would have been swept into space when the air rushed out into the vacuum.)
 Riker steps aside, gesturing to Data to record the scene on the viewer as:
 as it opens heavily and causes a slight AIR HISSING. Geordi ENTERS from the corridor, reacts to the AIR HISSING, hits a wall control on the inside. His expression changes to one of dismay as he looks around.
 CAMERA ANGLE REVEALS a room partially covered with frost. We glimpse several male and female bodies, scantily clad or (implied) nude, possibly a couple entwined. All are frozen and dead. Bits of frost-covered lingerie and other intimate clothing are scattered around. Geordi touches his insignia.
 as he HEARS A SOUND, the BUMP BUMP of a door bumping against the jamb. Geordi hurries across the small room toward the adjoining bathroom.
 Nothing inside, Geordi decides to check the closed shower stall, yanks the door open -- and a frozen WOMAN'S BODY, fully clothed, falls out into his arms. Although startled, Geordi has the presence of mind to catch the ice-covered corpse and lower it to the floor.
 Examining the frozen woman who had once been attractive, shakes his head in pity. He rests one hand on the wet side wall of the shower to brace himself as he prepares to stand upright again.
 Several drops of "water" on the icy shower wall where Geordi's hand rests coalesce and move onto his hand (per Justman effect).

 The Tsiolkovsky still drifts in space. The Enterprise is nearby. Over this:
 looking somehow strange, unstable, although we'd see no surface movement at this range.
 with Picard striding toward Dr. Crusher's office.
 Picard ENTERS, strides over to examine the viewing screen too.
 as before.
 Data is just getting up from one of the hospital beds as:
 The readings come on -- nothing radical anywhere.
 as Beverly looks up at the o.s. viewscreen, then:
 as Picard turns to his panel.
 as Riker ENTERS from a turbolift and crosses toward Data, who is working at one of the science stations at the rear of the Bridge. All other Bridge Personnel are in place -- Picard, Tasha, Worf at Ops, Crewman at Conn.
 Data looks up as Riker approaches him.
 He is resting on a hospital bed. Beverly finishes working over him with a medical instrument, checks a reading on it, moves toward her office. (NOTE: At no time does she touch him.)
 She sits down at her desk, compares readings on the medical instrument with something she has called up on the viewer.
 He sits up, takes off his communicator and lays it to one side. Then he gets to his feet, and quietly EXITS the Sickbay. A moment, then Beverly comes back IN -- stares at the empty bed, snatches up Geordi's communicator and runs for the door.
 The door slides open and she stands there, agitatedly staring up and down the corridor.

 Thank you, Counselor. Number One, our security chief has the equivalent of a snootful.

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the shapely rear end belongs to Tasha, and she is moving with the sexiest walk imaginable -- quite unlike her usual straightforward stride. Her whole expression has acquired a sexy pout. She approaches an intersection where several crewpersons are passing. Then, we HEAR GIGGLES, then a woman's LAUGHING SCREAM.
 From the reactions of the crewpersons in sight it is obvious that some have been infected and some not. Another CREWMAN is coming from the other direction and pauses as he sees Tasha swaying sexily toward him, openly flirting. She stops in front of him.
 She reaches out to pull him a little closer and plants one hell of a kiss on him. As he returns it:

 CHIEF ENGINEER SARAH MACDOUGAL and her ASSISTANT CHIEF JIM SHIMODA are working in the office at their consoles. They both glance up as the BOSUN'S WHISTLE SOUNDS, then:
 Picard looks around curiously as MacDougal approaches the command chair:
 Sheer disbelief.
 Captain's log, Stardate 41209.3. The strange contaminant that led to the deaths of the Tsiolkovsky crew is now aboard the Enterprise... and our Engineering Section has been commandeered by young Wesley Crusher...
 Number One, MacDougal -- get that boy out of Engineering.
 Worf at Ops, Data at the Conn station. Worf turns around toward Picard, concerned.
 Confirmed, sir. And there is a rather peculiar limerick being delivered by someone in the shuttlecraft bay. I am not sure I understand it... There was a young lady from Venus whose body was shaped like --
 Captain to Security, come in!
 A FORCEFIELD SHIMMER at the entrance to the Engineering Office, barring the way inside. Beyond the FORCEFIELD inside the office stands Wesley who is grinning at several Crewpersons, all of them clearly contaminated, who stand outside the FORCEFIELD. Assistant Chief Engineer Shimoda ENTERS, grinning and weaving slightly, walks up to the FORCEFIELD as:
 Never got as far as Sickbay, Wes. I feel too good for that.
 Wesley picks up a small control device, aims it at the FORCEFIELD which disappears. Shimoda steps inside, then Wesley turns the forcefield on again.
 The living space is low lit, provocative shadows. There is a CHIME, a beat, then the door slides open. Data stands there, hesitant, steps in. He looks around, not quite sure of himself.

Her hair is provocatively arranged... her makeup is especially dramatic and attractive... and she wears a pale blue diaphanous Theiss creation that promises revelations that will get us thrown off the air.

 Shimoda is sitting on the floor near an opened console, playing happily with a pile of isolinear chips (small colored slabs, rather like Chiclets), tossing them in the air or juggling them, staring at the pretty colors.

 She has a large beaker or futuristic-shaped container from which she is loading a hypo-spray. The hypo-spray filled, she moves across to where Geordi La Forge lies still strapped on the hospital bed. He is awake now, his face a picture of desolation. Beverly administers the hypo-spray and steps back to observe.
 No movement at all.

 Unlike Hagon and the Guards, he's beginning to enjoy this as Riker picks up the container Hagon had been holding, examines it and extends it to Picard.

 Picard ENTERS from the Ready Room and CROSSES toward his position. Beverly stays half concealed in the Ready Room entry. In the b.g. at the turbolift, WE'LL SEE Wesley quickly flatten himself almost out of sight. But Picard keeps looking in that direction and this fact finally forces Wesley SOMEWHAT INTO SIGHT.
 Wesley finally comes more fully INTO VIEW and meets Picard's eyes.

 This enclosed, sanded area, walled in black, has an ascetic, Zen-garden feeling with a pebbled center enclosing a small, off-center fountain. A single, simple, brilliant banner identifies this an important place, and whatever design elements are visible reveal an interest in the abstract, perhaps a Mondrian-ish feeling. Two sentries are posted beside a doorway. Picard and Troi BEAM INTO SHOT. Lutan and Hagon come from inside the doorway and exchange the "empty hands" ritual greeting with Picard.
 Under a canopy, a juggler performs. Guests sit on floor mats or cushions. All carry hand-held, delicately carved ivory-like sticks which they tap together to signal applause or approval. Tables are low and food is plentiful. ESTABLISH Lutan and Yareena sitting on a slightly raised dais, with Hagon next to him on floor level, and Lutan's Supporters close around them. The juggler drops something and suddenly stops. He has committed an act of dishonor.
 Picard and Troi scan the room, hoping to see Tasha. A sudden SCREAM from the direction where the juggler had performed.
 Picard and Troi whirl to look in that direction but their line of sight is quickly blocked by gift bearers who APPEAR, with Ligonian silks, works of precious metal, and fine large gems. Picard is troubled by what may have happened to the juggler but is distracted by the gift bearers making presentations. Then the room falls SILENT.

 The room is similar to Tasha's, but less elegant and much smaller. Picard paces.
 A pause, then Picard draws himself up into a pose resembling Data, and:
 revealing the above details, but without any poison demarcation.
 Tasha looks at the glavin carefully, hefts it, touches it, estimating it. Geordi comes over and looks at it with her.
 Outside, in the CENTERPLACE, the sharpened lengths of steel have been vertically attached within a multi-level rectangle. A number of these poles have horizontal segments connecting them. Yareena, wearing workout clothing, is maneuvering quickly from level to level, carefully avoiding the sharpened spikes. She wears the glavin on her left hand only, and uses the claw to give her leverage while swinging over and under the horizontal bars. It's obvious, as she climbs and jabs and slashes out, that she's very good at this. She never makes a mistake; the projecting needles never touch a pole, and she never makes a misstep. Below her, eight metallic objects outline the boundary of the arena. Between each of these, perhaps twenty inches off the ground, a brilliant green LIGHT BEAM defines the outer limit of the rectangle. As a workman puts the finishing touches on this apparatus, four additional green LIGHT BEAMS suddenly appear, emanating straight upward, from the four corners of the centermost section. To check them, he interrupts one of the beams with a stick of wood. It SIZZLES and begins to BURN.
 They look at one another.

 The Centerplace is alive with a gathering group of official spectators, who are seating themselves around Lutan and Hagon. Picard, Troi, Geordi, followed by Tasha and a guard, ENTER SHOT. Tasha wears the glavin with its protective covering. We begin to HEAR A RATTLE of ivory-like sticks from the Spectators.
 as she ENTERS with a Female Aide. LOUDER LIGONIAN RATTLING. A Guard motions Yareena and Tasha into the combat area. A worker prepares to activate the light-beam boundary. When it's quiet, Hagon rises and addresses the gathering.
 Tasha goes quickly for the center to defend from there, not sure exactly what to expect. Yareena, very sure of herself, climbs with agility. The glavin never gets too near her body. The glavins CLANG as each of the women climbs.
 Her eyes bright, her expression cold. She appears to always figure at least one move ahead.
 learning as she goes. She makes her moves without flare, steadily and carefully feeling her way. At the moment, it looks as if she's no match for Yareena.
 Yareena suddenly speeds up, agily climbing higher than Tasha. Gracefully, she also circles to get behind her. Tasha turns barely quickly enough to defend herself. Stopping, darting away, and coming from unexpected angles, Yareena forces Tasha to change position. Tasha at first clambers horizontally, then, aware of what's happening, climbs higher to get away from her, but can't do it without turning her back.
 Not at all as unconcerned as he indicates to Picard.
 Tasha folds her arms and dives beneath the horizontal pole, landing on her feet -- but loses her balance, and falls within the innermost section.
 Instantly, Yareena climbs toward her for the kill. As she raises her glavin to strike the final blow, her arm extends too far back, causing a metallic section of the glavin to brush against one of the brightly glowing vertical LIGHT BEAMS. This results in a shower of SPARKS and a reactive force so strong that it throws Yareena's arm forward with such speed that the glavin is hurled out of the arena and into the first row of spectators.
 Lutan rises, shouting.
 With Yareena re-armed, Tasha aggressively advances toward her.
 Very concerned now.
 Tasha moves rapidly to the outside, drawing Yareena up to follow her, then simulates losing her balance and fake-falls, flailing, toward the ground. She appears to be caught on the lower rungs without being able to free herself. Yareena drops deftly to her feet alongside her, stands over her and is about to shove the deadly spines of the glavin into her when Tasha kicks out with her foot, catching Yareena's leg. Yareena stumbles. Tasha gets to her feet and hurls herself at Yareena, getting on top of her. Her claw grazes Yareena's shoulder, ripping her garment and causing blood to flow.
 staring in horror at the thin TRAIL of blood. She starts slowly to rise up. The spectators gasp, waiting for Yareena to die.

 The crowd rises to its feet in surprise, then anger and SHOUTING. They begin to throw their ivory-like sticks toward the arena, then at our Away Party which quickly moves to one side, standing close.
 Security -- and Beverly, Data, and Riker -- are waiting as the supine bodies of Tasha and Yareena appear on the transporter pads.

 The object is beamed aboard. WE SEE the surprised faces of those in the room as a big black chest rests on the transporter pad. Its design is somewhat old-fashioned except for A ROUND SLEEPING HUMAN FACE ON ITS SIDE. The chest is seamless and featureless except for the slumbering Face. They circle it, looking for a way of opening it.
 Troi ENTERS the room, surprised to see them huddled at a chest.
 The Enterprise orbits Haven.
 Picard and Riker are with Troi. Riker is naturally perturbed; this is a woman he's loved although without any commitment being made. Picard is sorry to lose this top quality counselor and he's curious over how it happened -- and also curious about the effect of this upon these key officers.
 Picard and Troi face the platform. The Transporter Chief stands by the controls, the platform in b.g. SOUND of TRANSPORTER EFFECT, then THREE FIGURES MATERIALIZE.
 Troi's face reflects the fact that she's about to see her future husband for the first time in nearly three decades. Clearly, Picard is aware of the stress she feels and sympathizes.

 Intently curious and puzzled by what he's just seen, he turns to his console and begins calling up information rapidly.
 A deeply concerned Picard.

 Picard, Riker, Beverly, Geordi, Tasha and Troi are seated around the table with Data at the front viewer. INTERCUT this with viewer as necessary.
 The dinner party is in progress, attended by the Bridge Officers, the Millers, Mrs. Troi and Mr. Homn, all of whom are standing, chatting, having a drink as the dinner table is made finally ready. The officers wear ceremonial dress. Mrs. Troi wears a length of vine which seems at this time to be merely decorative. Mr. Homn stands erect by himself at a small table to one side. There are a dozen or so tall, fluted glasses on the table, along with a small bell suspended from a unique, arched crescent. Homn watches the goings-on like a silent sentinel.

 She looks on in wonder as Homn, now seated, downs an astonishing quantity of liquid, drinking one glass after another, without stopping, each with a different color.

 Wyatt BEAMS INTO a small, curved-wall room on the spherical Tarellian ship, the supplies alongside him. He is alone. The ship is quiet, except for THE HUM of the engines fighting the tractor beam. He moves forward, looking around.
 The room is minimally furnished, with an open door to what seems like a bridge, navigational equipment indicated beyond. But it's the walls that are mesmerizing. PORTRAITS OF WYATT, RANGING FROM BOY TO MAN, are everywhere. He moves about the empty room in astonishment, his heart pounding wildly.

 He is still at a loss, but Troi is smiling at him.

 As TRANSPORTER EFFECT MATERIALIZES the Visitors. KOSINSKI has the look of someone operating at top performance. His ASSISTANT, a humanoid alien, is small, physically non-threatening, with a way of allowing himself to blend into the background in a shy, good-natured way. Kosinski dominates the room. He's obsessed with himself and what he does. His manner is arrogant, his demeanor authoritarian; he pulls every eye toward him.
 as they watch Kosinski leave.
 A dramatic HIGH ANGLE as Kosinski, his assistant, Riker, and Argyle ENTER the area. There are some members of the duty watch there -- as well as Wesley, who's working on a school-related science project.
 He turns and faces them. (While this discussion plays out, Kosinski's assistant -- who remains uninvolved -- has become attracted to Wesley's project and steps over beside the young man. This is a small thing which should go almost unnoticed.)
 They are irritated by Kosinski's arrogance, yet it's strangely reassuring. This self-assurance, coupled with his record of success, makes them begin to think what he proposes is possible.
 He steps closer for emphasis.
 He gestures his assistant over to sit at an adjacent, secondary computer keyboard. Then the assistant works rapidly at this keyboard.
 It is a three-dimensional geometric display which builds and grows as WE WATCH, becoming a wonderfully complex and incredibly beautiful pattern. It is nothing we recognize nor understand. It is a theoretical representation of warp power.
 exchanging a puzzled look as:
 Drawn by curiosity, he moves closer to the computer screen. The assistant, curious over the expressions playing over Wesley's face, moves in beside him. In b.g. Kosinski is touching a button or so on the keyboard which produces minor changes on the screen as he continues.
 Wesley and assistant slightly in b.g. at their keyboard.
 The computer formula changes slightly.
 as the assistant looks approvingly at what Wesley has put on the viewer. Kosinski glances over to see Wesley at the computer.

 as he sees a strange phasing occur to the Alien. Riker and the others are intent on the main screen and will miss this.
 Streaks appear on his hands and face. Like gaps, where there is literally nothing -- emptiness. In these streaks he seems to DISAPPEAR -- then REAPPEAR, PHASING IN AND OUT.
 confused -- concerned. But before he can say anything, a GREAT EXPLOSION OF SPEED happens. The ship shudders once.
 The great ship leaps forward with a WARP SPEED EFFECT ON TOP OF A WARP SPEED EFFECT.
 WE SEE it as a DOUBLE IMAGE EFFECT which now slowly becomes a SINGLE IMAGE. Picard is the first to react.

 There is stunned silence for a beat. These are highly-trained people -- there is no chaos -- no running around -- no screaming and yelling. Everyone is under very tight, very tense control.
 Past what looks to be a "normal" sized planet, a huge section of space is dominated by an immense cloud of luminous gas and space dust. As indicated by the size of the planet in f.g., a really BIG cloud! A star is forming and when complete, and this one will have a mass

 the assistant slumped at a seat in a secluded area of Engineering. They're generally unnoticed by Engine Room personnel who are working as keyed up as the crew we saw on the bridge.
 I've always suspected this rate of speed was possible, of course, but, at this level -- never. We are going to need new definitions. New parameters.
 Kosinski hesitates for just a moment, then firms up and swells up too.
 Considers it, then makes his decision, sighs.
 Kosinski MOVES TOWARD the computer where his assistant is waiting. Wesley has stepped over next to Riker.
 In the Control Room area, Kosinski walks over to his assistant; Wesley moves quickly -- protectively -- to the assistant's side.
 Picard is in his position. Troi is on his left. Tasha is at the Tactical Station, Worf is monitoring the Aft Stations, Geordi has the Conn and Data is at Ops.
 Kosinski's arrogance bristles.
 Picard gives the order.
 Everyone here is holding one thought -- SPEED! GO!
 He works the computer panel -- but nothing is happening. The color drains from his face.
 stepping closer -- and for the first time -- he, too, sees the difference between what Kosinski is doing and what his assistant is now doing.
 With great effort, the assistant forces himself to concentrate.
 It's clear to him now. It's not Kosinski who's special -- it's the assistant. CAMERA CENTERS ON assistant who focuses his total attention on the computer. Again he phases -- pieces of him seem to disappear -- as though leaving this dimension for another. Then, what he's doing HAPPENS.
 It disappears. But this time it is a kind of speed unlike anything ever seen.
 Everyone reacting as the entire bridge and everyone on it seems DISASSEMBLED AND REASSEMBLED IN THE WINK OF AN EYE.
 This time, multiples on top of multiples of the WARP SPEED EFFECT.

 Something causes him to turn from his station and glance to the side. What he sees makes him smile -- it's the first time we've ever seen Worf smile. He stands and moves toward it.
 (Type of animal yet to be determined -- but it is LARGE.) Worf and it are happy -- in a uniquely Klingon way -- to see each other. But the rest of the bridge crew are now on their feet, alarmed.
 You're telling us that's a kittycat?

 as turbolift comes to a quick stop. Picard is already moving forward as the doors OPEN onto NOTHINGNESS. A sheer drop to the infinite. A vicious wind rips at Picard where no wind is possible.
 He jams himself against the back of the turbolift. His mind reeling. The doors automatically CLOSE. Then, almost before Picard can react, the doors OPEN again. He braces, steps gingerly OUT.

 There is an explosion of speed -- but not as much as we saw when coming out here.
 Picard and the Bridge crew -- intent on their instruments...
 The Traveler and Kosinski increase their tempo. The phasing occurs.
 The phasing stops; the Traveler looks concerned at this. Wesley moves closer, touches the Traveler anxiously on the shoulder -- and then a major phasing occurs. Traveler smiles at Wesley, but shakes his head at the hand on his shoulder. Wesley withdraws it, continues watching. The Traveler phases -- almost out this time, then back, then:
 It happens. The same effect that brought the ship out here.
 Phasing so completely his image is almost gone. Wesley reacts, concerned. Then the Traveler DISAPPEARS.
 Shaken, somehow, he realizes the Traveler is gone this time for good.

 As he begins groggily coming back to consciousness, a small grown HAND WITH BLUE COLORED NAILS roughly rips Riker's Starfleet communicator symbol from his uniform.
 Sitting opposite Riker on a crystalline rock is a little Ferengi humanoid, LETEK, leader of this group. His eyes Two other Ferengi MOVE INTO SCENE, puffing as they drag the heavy weight of Worf into the clearing to be laid out alongside Geordi and Data. They are KAYRON and MORDOC.

 The Ferengi are clearly unafraid of the larger humans and Tasha has had to be alert with her phaser to keep them in place. But now the Ferengi have evolved a plan. It begins with Letek seeming asleep -- the other two suddenly striding OFF. Tasha brings her phaser up:
 The two Ferengi are ignoring Tasha. (We're also now HEARING the mysterious THUNDER SOUND nearer and LOUDER.)
 With the attention of the human on the phaser, Letek snatches up his "whip" device and SNAPS it toward the humans. They turn in time to the WHIP EFFECT HEADED IN THEIR DIRECTION -- BUT LIKE THE PHASER EFFECT IT CURVES TOWARD THE "CORAL" TREE AND DISSIPATES THERE.

 The Enterprise begins passing just through the wispy edge of it.
 Worf is where he moved in at the console relay. Geordi is standing to one side. Suddenly there is a BRIEF GLOW (OPTICAL) from the key console to Worf. The big Klingon jerks as though something has struck him, and he convulses spasmodically and collapses. Geordi tabs his communicator instantly.
 plunging through space at warp speed, leaving the Worf still lies in a heap on the floor, Geordi leaning over him and checking for life signs. Worf begins to stir, slowly at first, as the doors SLIDE OPEN and Beverly and ASSISTANT ENTER at a dead run, medical devices in hand. They quickly kneel at Worf, begin checking him.
 What happened?
 He stops struggling, looks around with eyes that seem to be seeing for the first time. An expression of wonder and amazement crosses his face. Beverly and Geordi exchange a glance, both clearly concerned.
 Picard is at his desk, Geordi standing before it. Picard looks up at him, frowning as:
 Worf lies on an examination table, Beverly and assistant working over him with her medical scanners. Troi looks up at the o.s. medical viewscreen, then back at Worf. The Klingon is quiet now, his eyes moving around the room and to the women. His attitude is one of quiet and deep curiosity. Beverly finishes, smiles down at Worf.
 on their ENTRY:
 BADAR N'D'D is wraith-thin, pale, with glittering lupine eyes; and when he curls his mouth in what looks like a smile, some extremely long, sharp canines are revealed. His clothing can only be described as disreputable -- dark and loose, somehow lumpy (as though it hides body parts we don't want to know about). Tasha's tremulous smile is offset by a twitch of her nose that indicates Anticans don't smell too nice. Riker ENTERS.
 I thought that had been taken care of in advance, Tasha.
 Worf lies sedated on one of the beds, being automatically monitored by the medical computers. Beverly approaches with a medical instrument in hand to take some samples. She leans over the bed, using the instrument on his arm. As she does, there is a SUDDEN SPLIT-SECOND BURST OF ELECTRIC-LIKE ENERGY BETWEEN THEM. Beverly is highlighted briefly by a BLUE GLOW (OPTICAL). She steps back away from the bed, blinking as if trying to assimilate some new information.
 Troi ENTERS from the Corridor. Beverly looks around at her, puzzled, as Troi moves closer, looking up at the medical viewscreen.

 Wesley is in the living area, working with a P.A.D.D. and a Viewscreen, quickly tapping commands into the P.A.D.D. and watching figures or diagrams change on the o.s. viewer. The quarters doors are HEARD to SLIDE OPEN, and Wesley looks around.
 Beverly comes in, looks around apparently startled as Wesley speaks, but she seems to recover composure quickly. (NOTE: Throughout, Beverly appears remote, not displaying her normal warmth toward her son, views him almost as though he is an interesting stranger.)
 He glances around as the turbolift doors OPEN, and Beverly ENTERS and advances down the ramp toward Geordi, back at his helm position. (NOTE: She is still not acting in her usual manner. Everything about the bridge seems to be of interest to her, as though she's never seen it before. She responds with darting, curious little looks when spoken to, not quite able to focus long on the person whom she addresses. Her speech patterns have become very formal, also not like her. Also notice she does not call the captain by his rank or address him as "sir.")
 moving to where Data is in view too. She begins calling up information. Innocently, Data glances to her Viewscreen. What he sees there puzzles but does not alarm him.
 Picard looks around, concerned over Beverly seeming to be disoriented.
 Then, quickly, from the communications panel:

 He is irritated, pacing, snapping off his comments with a certain amount of acid etching his words. Through the window WE CAN SEE warp stars flashing past.

 They are at one of the consoles, Singh doing something complex at a panel, with Geordi and Wesley looking over his shoulder.
 Worf is at Conn, routinely monitoring his panel and appearing to be no worse for wear after his ordeal. Suddenly, he straightens, tabs in a command, frowns, tabs it again.

He reviews the schematic currently on the screen, nods to himself, reaches for the panel again. Suddenly, a BLUE GLOW SURROUNDS HIM (OPTICAL), and he stiffens, shaking convulsively. A SCREAM is choked off as the power racks his body -- and he plummets off the chair to the deck. The BLUE GLOW FADES... leaving him lying motionless on the floor. A beat, Worf ENTERS from the Corridor outside Engineering.

 Tasha is very upset over Singh's death.
 They are clustered around the console where Singh died. Geordi is examining the panels there; Wesley steps up from behind, indicates a place on the panel.
 We now have warp capacity, sir. All power on line.
 The ship leaps into warp, the stars blurring as she makes the jump.
 The quarters are still low-lit, mysterious. Badar N'D'D reclines on a low couch, looking up at Tasha with complete disinterest.
 as Worf APPEARS at the door of Beverly's office where Troi and Beverly wait.
 They are gathered in chairs near the windows. (Warp speed.) Riker and Tasha compare notes on a portable viewer pad. Data is watching... and smoking a "Sherlock Holmes" style pipe. Tasha is more troubled by this than Riker.
 Troi has a small machine before her which emits a resonant, melodic HUM and on which LIGHTS FLASH in a systematic pattern. She has just finished a "pass" with it in front of Beverly's face. Beverly sits in the desk chair in a light hypnotic trance. Worf watches intently; he has just gone through this himself.
 Picard is at his desk, facing Troi, Beverly, Riker, Data (with pipe), and Tasha; we're at warp speed as WE COME IN:
 Riker and Picard exchange looks.
 Geordi is at his usual Conn station; Wesley sits beside him at Ops. Worf is seated in Riker's chair. Supernumeraries are at aft stations.
 Wesley is quiet, faintly depressed. Geordi looks over at him, grins.
 What is it?
 Picard ENTERS bridge fast, Riker, Troi, Tasha, Data FOLLOWING, moving toward their stations. Beverly FOLLOWS them out onto the bridge, as:

 The corridor is oddly low lit. As the turbolift DOORS OPEN and Riker STEPS OUT, he glances around, frowning at the lack of light. He starts toward Engineering, and a SPARKLING LOOP suddenly whips over his head and around his neck. He lurches back, yanked by the garrote; then it is abruptly loosened. Riker regains his balance as the garrote is whipped away from his neck, and he turns to see:
 What in hell... ?
 He is working feverishly at an o.s. personal Viewscreen, absorbing the information at an intense rate. A CHIME SOUNDS, and he looks up as though he is not sure at first what it means. Then he registers and:
 The doors slide OPEN, and Beverly ENTERS. She is in medical "blues." She is trying to appear relaxed and confident, but nagging thoughts run around her mind asking about why she is really here.
 You don't care to inspect them?
 The Enterprise slows to impulse power as it heads for the large energy pattern "Cloud" which can be seen in far b.g.
 All officers at their regular duty stations, except for Picard, who is not present. Riker is in the command chair.
 The energy pattern "shape" spreads out across the reach of space, as we saw it earlier.
 as he looks at the viewscreen. His face is transformed, showing longing and even a kind of love. Then he turns to the bridge.

 A resignation from this command and from Starfleet has been appropriately recorded...

 Captain! I'll help you if you'll let me... 
 as in the darkness WE MAKE OUT a Figure ENTERING the turbolift, the door CLOSING.
 Intermittently ILLUMINATED BY THE BRILLIANT FLASHES as he gets zapped again, then again, struggling to reach the captain's panel.
 Darkened too, but the FLASHING RED LIGHTS illuminate Picard turning into the Transporter Room.
 where a crewman lies unconscious. Picard, relieved to see the crewman stirring somewhat, makes a setting on the transporter panel, jumps to the platform as WE HEAR the TRANSPORTER SOUND begin.
 as the TRANSPORTER EFFECT takes Picard away from the Enterprise.
 The Enterprise hovers even closer to the "cloud," waiting.
 Riker is in the command chair -- all others at their usual stations except Tasha who ENTERS very concerned and upset. Riker glances around the bridge, then:
 She stiffens suddenly in her seat, reaching out to grab Riker's arm.

 The "cloud" moving toward us -- then we're into it.
 Riker still intent on the viewer.
 Worf is suddenly startled by a reading on his panel.
 An area of static is APPEARING. The STATIC IMAGE is undefined at first but is becoming a "shape," although not yet recognizeable.

 The TRANSPORTER EFFECT builds slowly, a bit unevenly... then firms up, finally MATERIALIZING PICARD. He looks around, surprised.
 The "cloud" in far b.g. as WE SEE the Enterprise go into WARP SPEED EFFECT.
 A lovely blue and white planet, close to Earthlike in appearance.

 PICARD, TROI, WORF and WESLEY on duty with replacement bridge crew, all examining the planet, as:
 shows evidence of learning and civilization. My first officer has taken an away team down to make contact and they are in the process of returning to the ship.
 Picard looking to Troi.
 The same lovely planet.
 The planet is as described. We are at an inhabited part of it... clean, neat, the "streets" appearing more like a running track, bordered with flowers. The TRANSPORTER EFFECT brings in our new away team of Riker, Troi, Tasha, Worf and Wesley. In the near distance, a group of very human appearing people have seen them arriving and two of them turn and race in this direction. Worf is quickly aware of it and prepares to interpose himself protectively.
 ARRIVING at high speed. A young female and male who, like other Edo we'll meet, are both tall, full haired, with even white teeth, great bodies. They're also dressed in loose, sexy clothing and these two wear a silvery necklace indicating high rank. Riker is watching an attractive Edo woman, saying:
 who find themselves out in front of Tasha and Troi.
 Rivan and Liator leading the Enterprise people along another lovely pathway where an elderly but very trim FIRST EDO CITIZEN and a pair of younger N.D. EDO CITIZENS see them coming and break into a run to join them. Lots of smiles and waves.
 The Enterprise people very much taken with the joy and good health they're seeing. First Edo citizen notes Tasha's light complexion and amazon form.
 A combination of conference and recreation facilities, lots of light and air and spectacularly healthy looking people in revealing but comfortable garb. SOUND of delighted ADULT LAUGHTER from inside the chambers too. Two adults and a child DEPART on the run, another older woman ARRIVES -- on the run too. She doesn't seem to be breathing very hard at all.
 ARRIVING on the run with their Edo companions. They haven't done too badly. Rivan stops, looks Riker and the Enterprise people over, then moves in and embraces Riker again.
 The kind of place you'd like to visit. No particularly formalized furnishing plan -- it includes just about any way anyone would like to sit or loll. The same sort of revealing but sensible garb here too -- along with good humor. In fact, joy is what is mainly present here. Lots of fruit, nuts, food and drink selections. A MUSIC GROUP of Harpists in sight -- admittedly strange looking harps on which they compose, and now and then PLAY LILTING MUSIC which, like everything else, is not taken too seriously here either.
 as they are taken charge of with great hospitality.
 The same lovely planet.
 as Data ENTERS bridge from the turbolift, strides rapidly toward his station, his face reflecting concern.
 as the IMAGE there shifts slightly, but REVEALS nothing but the planet and star background previously seen.
 The partially transparent Mystery Object as described, positioned very close to the starship Enterprise. Its very nearness implies threat.
 The Red Alert lights FLASHING, the KLAXON SOUNDING a couple more times, then going SILENT. The mystery object IMAGE is on the Main Viewer; Picard and the others are as we last saw them.
 Geordi ENTERING on a run, racing to the first large port, from which the mystery object/vessel thing can be seen from here too. He stands examining it. Then:
 Picard intent upon:
 REVEALING A TINY PINPOINT OF LIGHT having come out of the side of the mystery object (no hatchway visible) CROSSING orbital space toward the Enterprise.
 Data watching Main Viewer.
 Still smaller now, the PINPOINT OF LIGHT moves toward the starship then actually passes through its "solid" side.
 Several crewpersons stopping, astonished at the sight of what this CLOSER VIEW shows as the SWIRLING BLOB OF LIGHT comes INTO SIGHT near the corridor deck and passes on an upward diagonal path of EXITING VIEW near the ceiling beyond. (It is on its way to the bridge.)
 where Conn is reacting to an alarm from his panel. Geordi RE-ENTERS bridge, takes his position.
 Picard has come to his feet, watching as the TINY SWIRLING LIGHT OBJECT which moves in his direction, and STOPS. Picard has tried not to retreat before the mysterious thing, but it is with some difficulty. Conn has moved in holding a large hand phaser ready, but has gotten a headshake from Picard. Then, from the tiny swirling light object, a VOICE we'll come to know as the EDOLORD. THE WORDS ARE TRANSMITTED WITH SUCH VOLUME THAT THEY LITERALLY SHAKE THE BRIDGE (OPTICAL OR CAMERA JIGGLE). A couple of the bridge crew throw hands to ears protectively. At the same time, we HEAR SOUND OF SOMETHING SHATTERING "GLASSLIKE" AS IT COMES APART, various PANELS FLARE WITH LIGHT.
 Picard fighting to stay calm. As he realizes he has heard the entire message:
 Data moves toward the Command Area, examining the LIGHT SWIRL.
 genuinely puzzled over Picard's last statement. Suddenly the TINY LIGHT SWIRL RISES TOWARD DATA, comes to rest floating inches in front of his face. Then, Data registers a surprised expression now as he continues looking at the SWIRLING LIGHT OBJECT. Then:
 His entire form GLOWING as he goes stiff, eyes rolling back in their sockets.
 ESTABLISHING.
 as Wesley comes INTO VIEW with THREE EDO YOUTHS of about his own age, two male and one a very pretty young female who has very much caught Wesley's attention. The boys have a ball; they're all smiling, laughing.
 Riker in the midst of reacting to something Worf has just said. With him the balance of the away team is mixing happily with various of the Edo.
 Not wanting to create a false emergency, he works his way toward Tasha carefully. She's with Rivan, Liator and other Edo.
 Wesley INTO VIEW with his friends, still tossing the ball back and forth. He makes a difficult catch, capturing the Edo girls' admiration again. (In b.g. is an attractive, glassed potting shed surrounded by a low white fence.)

 Leaping for the ball, missing... falling into the potting shed.
 The girl hanging back, ANXIOUS. The boys pressing in, short of the white fence. Wesley lying in the broken glass of the Shed.
 REVEALING a pair of Edo MEDIATORS (local law enforcement) hurrying toward the potting shed area in b.g. They are middle-aged men, exceedingly trim and healthy-looking, also kindly in appearance. Their only indication of office is a neat belt and pouch. But at the sight of them the girl SHRIEKS AGAIN and it is from genuine despair and fear for Wesley.
 as Wesley climbs back over the fence, brushing himself off. The Edo young people now back away, awed at what has happened.

 CONTINUING LAST SHOT with the exception that Beverly is now present, leaning over Data and checking him with a medical tricorder. Both are also anxiously aware of the tiny LIGHT SWIRL and his GLOWING FORM.
 Both anxious.
 as Picard shakes his head.
 REACTING to this, and to the LIGHT GLOW fading from Data whose eyes remain closed. Beverly reaches in quickly, touching Data, examining him again.
 Reactions from the others to that and to the SOUND of TASHA'S VOICE in mid-message:
 Beverly checking readings on her medical tricorder again.

 ESTABLISHING. As before, both young and old are seen traveling easily at a run.
 in which Picard is being led to what appears a "seat of honor" next to Rivan, Liator, other planet folk. Riker, Troi and Geordi are moving in to take a place next to the Captain. Hovering anxiously nearby are Tasha and Worf holding their small phasers unobtrusively in hand as they scan the Edo, alert for any further surprises.
 Before Picard takes his seat, he moves Troi aside, speaks quietly:
 as Picard, Troi and Rivan BEAM OUT.
 still in orbit of the planet together.
 Picard, Troi and Rivan ENTER SCENE coming down the corridor. Rivan is astonished by what she is seeing. She looks from Troi to a couple of very efficient appearing crewmembers who are passing.
 as Picard, Troi and Rivan ENTER from turbolift.
 REVEALING THE MYSTERY VESSEL/OBJECT out beyond what WE CAN SEE of the Enterprise. CAMERA PANS to Rivan, Picard, Troi, and Beverly. At the instant Rivan sees it, she drops to one knee, clenching her eyes closed, with hands crossed over her chest.
 Rivan actually trembling. Troi bends close, speaks encouragingly:
 Troi is pointing agitatedly to where the mysterious object/vessel is GLOWING BRIGHTER, and the bridge begins to shake as WE HEAR THE IMMENSE VOLUME OF THE VOICE WE HEARD EARLIER IN THE BRIDGE.
 Picard steps back from her, his insignia attached to her clothing.
 as slowly the LIGHTS COME ON and the EDOLORD OBJECT/VESSEL RETURNS TO ITS ORIGINAL DISTANCE FROM ENTERPRISE.
 as a turbolift door opens, Picard and Beverly EMERGING to stride down the corridor toward Sickbay.
 Data is conscious, being scanned on Sickbay equipment by a MEDICAL TECHNICIAN. As Beverly and Picard ENTER, the Technician pauses in what he is doing.

 PICARD at his desk, star charts on a nearby monitor. He's in some physical discomfort, presses his knuckles to his temple, GROANS. We HEAR a CHIME from his door.
 RIKER, TROI, DATA, GEORDI, TASHA, and WORF are at their usual stations. Picard ENTERS JOINING Riker at the Command Area. The Main Viewer displays the Ferengi vessel.
 Beverly is using twenty-fourth century diagnostic tools to examine the prone Captain.
 Riker, Troi, Data, Geordi, Tasha and Worf on duty as WESLEY ARRIVES by turbolift, hurriedly addresses Riker:

 seeming to become absorbed in the story.
 The past and the present.
 A BEAM OF LIGHT explores the deserted bridge. Signs of fire still remain, blackened consoles and scorched wall panels. It comes to rest on a wall PLAQUE, which Data reads out loud:
 Riker's in command, Picard absent.
 Picard, Beverly and Tasha are present on the pads.
 as the captain and companions MATERIALIZE. Picard stands still for a moment, a living "deja vu" in process.
 Not as much fire damage here as on the bridge. Picard sits center, an old travel chest cracked open and several items from it on a nearby table. He pulls out an old framed diploma from it, inspects it.
 where taking out the diploma has REVEALED A METALLIC SPHERE which is about a half-meter in diameter. Suddenly it GLOWS, HUMS.

 Picard again racked with pain.
 ESTABLISHING again.
 Kazago is seen on our starship's Main Viewer. Riker is looking in that direction.
 Picard ENTERING, passes his chest and the other things we saw in his Stargazer cabin. He goes to his bunk, throws himself down heavily.
 A beat as he rests, then he breathes with almost a GROAN, and CAMERA BEGINS MOVING IN TO EXTREME CLOSE SHOT. VOICES FADE IN; ECHOES FROM THE PAST.
 Riker waiting while Data closes the door. He offers the nearby monitor to Riker.
 as the Enterprise tows the Stargazer by its tractor beam.
 Picard was guilty of falsifying the report he made to Starfleet concerning the Stargazer's last voyage.
 Picard seems stunned by what he's hearing from his desk computer, his own voice plays back quietly under the scene, not to be understood.
 from which Picard's VOICE now plays NORMAL VOLUME.
 as Riker and Picard hear NORMAL VOLUME:
 Riker ENTERS on his way to the Ready Room.
 Riker's seated in Picard's chair, as he hails the Ferengi.
 Bok's using the sphere, the wall screen a strong pattern of wavy lines (as in twentieth century oscilloscopes).
 Picard is now GROANING, suffering intense pain. The door chime SOUNDS.
 Bok makes an adjustment, and the discordant hum "tunes" the lines to move faster.
 Picard has another terrible wave of pain, which doubles him over, to Beverly's surprise.
 Bok makes another adjustment, and the lines move slower.
 Beverly seems to be getting results, as Picard responds.
 as both SLOW, against the starry forever.
 Picard's back is AWAY FROM CAMERA. A beat, then a MOAN... He shifts his leaden weight, in an unconscious attempt to get comfortable, as CAMERA SLOWLY TIGHTENS. Over which, reverb VOICES, muted.

 All at their usual stations, minus Picard, plus Beverly.
 Bok is very pleased with Picard's suffering, as the Ferengi puts down the silver-grey sphere and its GLOWING and HUMMING stops. Picard's pain subsides but not his confusion.
 The Ferengi vessel still in far b.g. The Stargazer, powered, fully lit, is turning, moving away from the Enterprise.

 PICARD is in his Command chair, TROI to his left. WORF at the Aft Station. GEORDI has the Conn, DATA on Ops. TASHA at Tactical.
 Her face is full of apprehension.
 He turns. KLAXON HONKING - LIGHTS FLASHING.
 The Main Viewer SHIMMERS as an unusual SHINING, SPARKLING GRID SHAPE APPEARS, seeming to stretch across the whole of the galaxy ahead of them.
 He recognizes the shape - he has seen it before en route to Farpoint Station.
 Now reading full stop, sir.
 Reflections of the BRILLIANT DIAMOND-BLUE LIGHT on their faces as they look ahead toward this newest Shape of "Q". They shield their eyes from it.
 A WRITHING SNAKE with snapping fangs, continuing mixed HISSING, DARTS toward them from whence came the "Q" light image.
 Both Worf and Tasha vaulting down onto the Command deck, instinctively drawing phasers as they try to position their own bodies between the frightening Snake-thing and the bridge Crew, as we:
 First one, then the other, discover phasers inoperative. The snake head seems an instant away from fanging them...

 The bridge crew are standing in approximately their previous bridge positions on a treeless planet plain. They have just been snatched from their ship, their captain and they are understandably confused and uncertain except for Tasha and Worf whose security orientation have them immediately combat ready. This place is bright, hot.

 Data and Geordi, looking up too, move in next to Riker.
 who stands where a rock formation has previously hidden him. He is now wearing a French MARSHAL'S uniform, circa the Napoleonic Wars. As Riker, very curious, moves toward "Q", CAMERA MOVES AND PANS TO REVEAL also a headquarters-type campaign tent of the same era, complete with shade canopy and transportable field furniture. "Q" indicates two such chairs with a small table which holds a pair of tall, cool drinks.
 as Riker inspects the remaining drink without sitting yet, picks it up and looks a question toward Troi.
 REACTING to the fact they suddenly have tall drinks of various colored liquids in their hands. Hesitantly, a couple of them sip. Worf, however, tilts his glass pouring the contents out onto the sand. Strangely, this pleases "Q"'s sense of humor.
 As the others react, Worf responds:
 but not in orbit of a planet. Instead, it seems to be traveling somewhere at what we know as normal warp speed. MUSIC only.
 Picard at a turbolift, touches the door, without effect. Then he tries to bang it.
 as Picard, startled, whirls toward the VOICE. It is Tasha who stands at her familiar position at security. Unusually for Tasha, she is showing some strain over what has been happening.
 seated in the Captain's Command position. He smiles, enjoys having startled Picard this way.
 All but Worf are there, studying a point on the distant terrain.
 Worf -- the trained warrior -- approaches with caution. It is indeed a bivouac area. Worf can hear the unseen men SPEAKING IN FRENCH. He edges closer.
 Worf pushes through the rocks, FREEZES.
 Two sentries are walking a perimeter patrol. They are dressed as Bonapartist soldiers, carrying muskets. As they approach, WE SEE their uniforms look genuine enough... but then we make out their faces! Humanoid but with fearsome, fanged, unhuman features.
 Worf reacts at this. Then he moves as close as he dares. Those in the camp appear to be preparing for a battle. But where human troops would be yelling, these soldiers are GROWLING, SNARLING. Over that, the CLATTER of caissons -- equipment being assembled.
 He hears a squad approaching -- slips back among the rocks and DISAPPEARS.
 with his back to Picard.
 The same plain. Riker, Troi and Data watch as Geordi scans the distant desert ridges.
 The PHASER SOUND precedes an EXPLOSION OF DUST AND DIRT at a point where Riker was aiming the phaser. It causes a hole at least the size of one caused by a howitzer shell.
 It also produces another effect -- the FORM of Worf, large phaser in hand, propelling itself INTO SCENE, rolling to a stop where the Klingon is aiming his phaser, seeking the away team's "assailant" which fired the phaser blast.
 Geordi, who has been scanning the terrain, now turns to Riker.
 Data's back is to him.
 Riker spins, FIRES HIS PHASER, DEMATERIALIZING both his opponents.
 Riker becomes aware of someone scrambling toward him. It's Data, the real Data using his own body. "Q" has gone. CAMERA JIGGLES WITH ANOTHER MAJOR PHASER HIT.
 The bridge is empty -- the displays and readouts are still frozen. The ambient noise is still absent. SLOW PUSH IN to Tasha sitting on the bench beside Riker's position. Head in hands, she stares at the floor. Suddenly the room noise changes and on the SOUND her head comes up.
 The display screens are alive. All the bridge's ambient SOUNDS are back. Tasha looks over to Picard's Ready Room.
 Picard STEPS OUT. He too has heard the change. He walks to his Command position.
 He sits and touches his arm-panel.
 at the Conn position.
 He looks at the readout.
 FLASHES OF LIGHT and the members of the bridge crew REAPPEAR except for Riker. Alive and unharmed.
 All of them are naturally disoriented -- the shock of the experience cannot be instantly thrown off.
 Empty -- no Riker. But there are footprints in the sand indicating a direction toward which is a jagged rock formation on the otherwise unbroken sandscape.
 REVEALING Riker who has managed to find himself a little shade. He sits, leans back against a rock. Then, starts to laugh. It is a deep, satisfying laugh from one who has just been let in on a cosmic joke.
 Standing on a ledge above Riker, heavily back-lit by the two suns. (If possible, formed here by two brightly illuminated OUT-OF-FOCUS balls as described earlier.) We'll see more clearly in a moment also that
 as "Q" moves down into TWO SHOT. Riker eyes "Q" for a long beat, then:
 where the entire bridge crew, including Picard and WESLEY, find themselves facing a line of the French uniformed "animal soldiers," who menace the Enterprise people, ATTACHING LONG AND DEADLY-LOOKING BAYONETS ONTO THEIR MUSKETS, clearly intending to use them.
 moving forward to take on the entire attack line. He moves fast, dodges a bayonet, trips, then a second animal soldier slashes him in the back with a bayonet, and Worf goes down in a SPURT OF RED BLOOD.
 as he FREEZES, shocked.
 Shocked, wildly angered!
 as Riker's gesture creates a smaller version of the METALLIC GRID. IT APPEARS between where the bridge Crew has instinctively retreated and the advancing line of animal soldiers, blocking them completely. Picard REACTS strongly to what Riker just did.
 Wesley APPEARS, suddenly feeling at his torso where he was just stabbed. He's no longer hurt. Worf ENTERS SHOT, also whole in body.
 Picard looking at Riker almost disbelievingly.
 with the Disaster Planet in far distance ahead of the starship -- a small ball seen from here.
 Riker, Troi, Data, Geordi, Tasha and Worf at their positions. Riker's features showing the strain of what has happened, he makes little eye-contact with the bridge crew and they appear equally uncertain of how to handle him.
 Riker CROSSING IN and coming to a halt in front of Picard's desk. Picard waves him to a seat, almost angrily.
 The Away Reserve Team MATERIALIZES. They are in a passageway which has been severely damaged by explosions. Water SPRAYS from the ceiling and is already ankle deep on the floor. Data scans the area with his tricorder.

 CAMERA MOVES IN TO E.C.U. Geordi is staring at a pile of rubble.
 With great strength he moves huge rocks with remarkable rapidity.
 They stand and look for a beat, then:
 as he lifts and carries the limp body of a child.
 Beverly rushes over and while Data holds the child, she quickly examines him.
 From her expression it is clear the child is dead. All of her skill will not help.
 He steps closer. A dead child. A moment of truth.
 He is fighting his emotions.
 Puzzled.
 in orbit.
 Riker, followed by Data and Geordi, EXIT the turbolift. Riker CROSSES to Picard. Troi is watching Riker with such intensity she doesn't seem to be breathing.
 It's as though he's been expecting this since the incident with "Q".
 The others are watching this exchange, curious about how Picard will respond.
 Riker is already there, sits brooding. Picard ENTERS with Data, Troi, Geordi, Tasha and Worf. As Picard seats himself:
 All whirl toward the VOICE. It comes from a far corner of the bridge where a Figure stands with its back to us. "Q" turns now, revealing himself draped in what is recognizable even in this century as the somber robes of something like the Franciscan Holy Order -- and "Q" is playing it to the hilt with gentle voice, kindliness shining from his face, fingers pointed together as in prayer. He CROSSES IN to stand with Riker, head bowed in humility.
 turning to his friends.
 Have your favorite wish, my young friend!
 Their REACTIONS. Their surprise is complete. On a very intimate level that concerns themselves, this seems godlike power they are witnessing. Picard, on the other hand, seems to be analyzing, measuring, what is happening.
 Riker is eyeing Data now.
 as Beverly appraises the new form of her son.
 as Riker moves to inspect him in turn.
 moving to Riker. His voice is that of an adult male.
 Everyone is speechless. Then, Picard breaks the silence.
 as it MOVES AWAY from us.
 The great ship circles a reddish planet. Behind both is the backdrop of a sparkling splash of stars against black space.
 All other bridge personnel are in place at their usual stations.
 REVEALING CLOSE UP OF ADMIRAL MARK JAMESON. The Admiral is a man of eighty, still crusty and alert, still a Starfleet warhorse. Jameson nods briskly as:
 On screen and relay to the admiral, Mister Data.
 The Screen FLASHES UP a sharp color picture of KARNAS in his OFFICE. There is a desk, several chairs. The wall behind the desk is barren, save for a set of three weapons mounted on it. Two of the weapons are phaser-like, but of old design and of different sizes. One of the weapons is a short pole about two inches in diameter with a wicked-looking blade on either end. Karnas sits at the desk, facing INTO CAMERA. He is in his sixties, with a formal, military bearing, a man with a good many worry lines marking his face, a man without many smiles.
 studying the screen as Karnas speaks.
 I feel there is only one negotiator with the skills and understanding to resolve this situation. The hostages' lives will depend on Starfleet delivering this man to Mordan. Commander Mark Jameson. Admiral Jameson. The terrorists have given you six Earth days to arrive here -- or the hostages will die. Please...hurry.
 Starfleet doesn't understand how or why this situation developed. Mordan IV has finally gained peace after decades of civil war --
 Forty years of civil war, Captain.
 My wife and I will beam aboard at 1500 hours, Captain. Be prepared to depart this starbase and proceed immediately to Mordan IV. Acknowledge.
 Received and acknowledged, sir. Picard out.
 Picard and Riker ENTER, glancing toward the platform.
 Two Figures are BEGINNING TO MATERIALIZE on the pads. As the TRANSPORTER EFFECT AND SOUND DIE DOWN Jameson and his wife, ANNE, FULLY MATERIALIZED. Jameson appears as he did on the Main Viewscreen -- except WE NOW SEE he has been confined to a "physical support chair," which greatly inhibits the physical movements of his lower body. The chair is enclosed around his hips and legs, hiding them from our view.
 He seems quite pleased with himself -- but also concerned for Picard's feelings.
 nonplussed -- but what can Picard do? He puts the best face on it he can and manages another smile.
 underway at warp speed, flashing by on her urgent mission.
 Geordi sees something on his console, turns in his chair toward Picard.
 Picard, Riker and Troi are in their usual positions, with Jameson installed in his support chair on Riker's right. They all respond with interest as:
 (KARNAS'S OFFICE) Karnas is seen seated behind his desk.
 The others glance over at Jameson, who sits up straighter in his chair.
 Karnas nods and squints INTO CAMERA as:
 It seldom is, Karnas. However, we could save a good deal of it now if you'll outline the terrorists' demands....
 They insist all discussions will take place here... on Mordan. They refuse to speak to me -- only to you.
 Jameson navigates his chair a little forward as:
 His expression flickers just slightly, but he nods toward Picard, acquiescing.

 Pardon me, sir, but refusing a simple medical check --

 Gathered around the desk are Picard, Riker, Data, Troi and Jameson.
 Anne is straightening out the final details of their quarters, putting away clothing items, etc. As Jameson ROLLS IN, seated in the support chair:
 as her voice comes OVER, we see he is beginning to feel pain... gradually at first, and then getting worse... and worse.
 A GASP from Jameson as he can no longer contain the pain. Anne swings around sharply, hurries to him.

 The great ship travels by at warp speed.
 All regulars at their stations, Jameson in the support chair surveying information at Science Station 2, near Worf. Beverly is seated on the guest bench near Troi.
 He turns slightly in the chair and smiles at Picard.
 staring at Jameson as he moves a little unsteadily but entirely on his own down the ramp. Halfway down, he stumbles slightly, and Riker reaches out a hand to him. Jameson waves him away, regains his balance and MOVES ACROSS to Picard.
 She is frowning deeply, not liking what she sees.
 Picard reins in his surprise, quickly collects himself. Jameson is grinning, pleased with his feat.
 traveling at warp speed.
 Picard has led the doctor into the room; Beverly is still disturbed by what has happened. As the door closes behind them, Picard turns to face her.
 traveling at high warp.
 He is seated at a desk, studying a personal Viewer. NOTE: The light is dim here, turned down so he can see the screen better.
 Jameson is reviewing the Karnas message seen in the Teaser.
 I don't know how much more information you think you can get out of that tape.
 She is frowning a little.
 Anne looks up at him, frightened and angry.
 The Captain is looking over her shoulder at the Viewer (o.s.). It is flashing up confirming information as she talks:
 as Picard ENTERS. Anne comes to meet him, concerned and frightened -- more than we'd expect her to be.
 He now looks like a man in his fifties -- vital, strong, still ready to take on the world.
 Admiral -- in addition to your rank, you are a particularly valuable commodity just now. Starfleet has a right to some answers.
 as they sit.
 Why didn't you tell me, Mark? We've always been honest with each other -- until now.
 He is seated at the table in front of a small Viewer. There is no one else in the room. The lights are DIMMED DOWN, and Jameson's face is largely in shadow.
 Picard sits up straight as:
 Karnas must have tried to negotiate with the terrorists before he was forced to call on me. I want all the information he has access to.
 You said he was a proud man... probably sensitive about his failure to deal with the situation. Is it wise to press him on this?
 NOTE: The LIGHTS in the room REMAIN DIM; Jameson is careful to remain back away from the light, so his face is in shadow and cannot be clearly seen.
 WE SEE Karnas, again in his office. His attitude is firm, formal, but with a touch of belligerence.
 We're on a secured channel, Karnas. You can talk freely. Who's behind this thing? You said dissidents.
 angry, determined now on a course of action.
 traveling as before at high warp speed.
 All personnel in their accustomed stations. Jameson ENTERS from the Conference Lounge doors, CROSSING to Picard as:
 The ship is traveling at warp speed against a background of streaking stars.
 Gathered in the Command area are Picard, Riker, Tasha, Worf, Troi. Jameson presides from the Command Chair. Data and Geordi are at their stations.
 Jameson was right. The GRAPHIC seen on the screen depicts what looks like a complicated crochet-work doily, every line indicating a tunnel.
 Admiral, even if you're right about Karnas being behind this, he still wants to negotiate. Or at least to talk. Why not hear what he has to say?
 They are gathered around Picard's desk as WE COME IN:
 Anne is miserable, carrying the signs of her anguish on her face.
 as before, traveling at high warp speed.
 as Picard ENTERS. It's dimly lit, indicating it's late
 He is seated further back from the windows, a drink of some kind in his hand. Picard changes direction and joins him as:
 Mordan is not a very promising looking planet. In fact, it's a mud-brown ball with some hints of blue and green. The Enterprise is in standard orbit.
 Jameson is standing, facing Picard and Riker. Already on the pad are Tasha, Worf, Data, Geordi. All are equipped with phasers. Data and Tasha also have tricorders. Jameson steps up on the pad.
 as before, the Enterprise holding standard orbit around the planet.
 as they MATERIALIZE IN THE TRANSPORTER EFFECT. As soon as the TRANSPORTER EFFECT FADES, the Team is immediately busy, checking phasers, Data taking tricorder readings. Jameson looks around, seems to recognize where he is. The tunnel itself is old, seems unmaintained.
 Data drops in beside Picard, staring at the tricorder screen in bewilderment.
 They round a corner -- and see the way has been blocked off. There was a hatch of some kind, but this has been cemented over. Geordi scans it with his VISOR.
 The two PHASER BEAMS slash in and cut a rough square in the blocked area.
 If you have the coordinates for where you think the hostages are, sir, we could just beam in there.
 The team moves along this tunnel, toward an intersection ahead. There is some debris in the way, as though part of the tunnel had given way at one time and has been shored up. Geordi is still scanning with his VISOR.
 Ahead of them, a SQUAD OF MORDANITE SOLDIERS has come around the corner of the intersection, armed and ready for action. Our team brings phasers up, but the Mordanites FIRE FIRST. Tasha moves herself in front of Picard, but he pulls her down flat behind the tunnel debris as PHASER-LIKE FIRE zips over their heads. The SOUND OF THE FIRE is different, flat and humming. Tasha begins to FIRE back.
 Jameson has unhitched his phaser and is firing quickly down the tunnel toward the Mordanites. Worf's fire is steady, methodical. Several Mordanites fall stunned as a result of our people's fire. Jameson moves away from the wall and the cover of Worf's body and tries to charge down the tunnel toward the soldiers, who are offering up a steady fire.
 Picard reaches out to try to stop Jameson, but the Admiral suddenly crumples, almost into Data's arms.
 as the team IS MATERIALIZED. As soon as the EFFECT STOPS, Picard bends down to where Data, supporting Jameson, is lowering him to the platform.
 WE DO NOT SEE Jameson's face, which is turned AWAY FROM CAMERA. He is doubled over, shaking violently as though palsied. Data looks up at Picard, frowning.
 WE DO NOT SEE his face. He CRIES OUT in agony, and writhes painfully.
 He is lying on one of the examination beds, face turned AWAY FROM CAMERA, still shaking in pain. Troi is standing by with Anne as a medtech monitors him closely.
 This last attack is the worst one he's suffered, sir. The others were overwith fairly quickly. He hasn't recovered from this one yet, and nothing has been able to relieve his pain.
 ENTERING from the aft turbolift. Riker comes out of the Command Chair toward him. NOTE: Data, Worf and Tasha are now back at their regular stations. Troi is not on the bridge.
 Karnas's image APPEARS ON SCREEN in the same setting as before.
 as Picard ENTERS. Beverly meets him, her face grim.
 Troi is trying to comfort Anne, who huddles at the side of the bed in utter despair. Picard approaches, looks down at the body there -- and his jaw drops.
 The eyes are alive and intelligent -- but the face and body Picard sees are those of a teen-aged boy. NOTE: Jameson's VOICE remains the same as before.
 Picard, I have to get to Karnas.
 A new demand from Karnas, sir. If we don't deliver Jameson in five minutes, a hostage will be executed. Fifteen minutes after that, another.
 He promises the method of execution will be both slow and painful.
 as Picard, Beverly (with medical kit) and the boy Jameson are mounting the platform. Jameson's uniform, while still that of an admiral, hangs loosely on him. Riker ENTERS, moves toward them as:
 The TRANSPORTER EFFECT MATERIALIZES the three figures directly in front of Karnas's desk. Karnas is waiting, puzzled to see three. There are several Mordanite soldiers in the room, but it will be noticed they are old soldiers -- veterans in their late fifties and sixties.
 as we left them. Karnas stares at the boy in the Starfleet uniform, dismisses him with a grunt, and turns to Picard.
 I'm waiting for an explanation, Captain.
 Beverly has helped Jameson to a chair. He seems to be weak, almost frail. Karnas paces in front of the desk, railing at Picard.
 Karnas, I've asked Doctor Crusher to bring down the visual records we've made of Admiral Jameson's deterioration. Will you look at them?
 The screen shows Jameson as he was at the beginning, in the physical support chair.
 Never again, Karnas.
 Still shots APPEAR in sequence -- Jameson as he began to de-age, as he became younger and younger.
 Karnas stares across the room at Jameson, who is being tended by Beverly. The boy has begun to shake. Not pain, but a quivering in the body that cannot be stopped.
 He is still shuddering, gets to his feet. Anne tries to hold his hand, but he pulls away from her. Beverly signals to her to let him go, but she keeps a close eye on him herself.
 A curious V-shaped scar arcs across the wrist, almost like a chevron.
 Karnas looks up at Jameson... and he finally believes.
 He holds for a long beat, and then he crumples to the floor with a CRY of agony. Beverly and Anne go to him immediately, Beverly running a quick scan with her instruments.
 as Karnas moves forward, laying the weapon down on his desk. Jameson CRIES OUT AGAIN, in terrible pain.
 Beverly looks up, shakes her head.
 Quietly, she moves in beside Beverly, who pulls back out of the way. Anne takes the boy's head in her arms, cradles him against her. No matter that this is just a young teenager now -- this is still the man she loved for fifty years.
 They are old eyes, filled with the memories of eighty years. And then they close for the last time.
 As the others look on, Anne begins quietly to weep. Karnas moves closer, staring down at the strange body of his old enemy. Finally:

 as the sleek starship begins her pull away from the planet and heads for the stars.
 The ship passes over us slowly, giving a distinct impression of its great size...
 RIKER sits alone at the Command Area. WESLEY and WORF man the Ops and Conn; DATA is at Science One.
 PICARD is earnestly studying. WE SEE a text filled with Jaradan (HA-RAH-DAN) figures and their English equivalents.

 Picard touches the COMPUTER panel on the wall.
 At the end of the hall is a wooden door with a glass window. The letters on the pane read "DIXON HILL, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR."
 Hill's SECRETARY, a plain blond with a bubbly personality, is just on her way to lunch. She looks Picard up and down with bemusement...
 The ship smoothly cruises through the starry blackness of space. Over this:
 detective who has been a hero of mine since childhood.
 The illusion is flawless. The computer characters accept me as Dixon Hill, even to the extent that Jessica Bradley, a millionaire's wife from the wrong side of the tracks, wants to hire me.
 The SILHOUETTE of a small man CAN BE SEEN though the pane. He knocks again, delicately; his knuckles sounding like a woodpecker rapping on a hollow tree.
 Picard walks down the corridor and turns the corner to the main entrance to the Holodeck.

 The LIGHTS momentarily FLICKER as the probe races through the bowels of the ship.
 WE HEAR A HIGH PITCHED COMPUTER BLEEP, and the Holodeck doors open by themselves. WE CAN VAGUELY SEE the hallway leading to Dixon Hill's office. Then, abruptly, the doors slam shut.

 A grave look on his face. He punches the intercom.
 I told you, he's in the Holodeck.
 Something's... gone wrong.
 There's silence on the bridge. Everyone's heard the strange halting tone of Lieutenant La Forge. He sounds serious.
 PULL BACK SLOWLY as Geordi stops trying to access the panel.
 Ship's log, supplemental. First officer reporting. Due to an unknown breakdown in the Holodeck, we are unable to locate the captain and his party...
 Tasha, take over. I'm going to Holdeck Three.
 Wesley, at Ops, spins in his chair to face Riker.
 The captain is still sitting under the hot light of an arc lamp. Bell is leaning forward, intensely grilling him. McNary stands in the shadows...
 Whalen and Data continue to move about the room, fascinated by everything from the chairs to the light bulbs. To them, this is a firsthand look at ancient history.
 Bell and McNary have been arguing in a corner of the room. As McNary approaches Picard, it's clear that he's won for the time being.
 Picard steps out into the waiting room.
 WE CAN SEE the hallway in Dixon Hill's office building.
 They ENTER to find the same little man we saw before, waiting for Dixon Hill.

 Riker is standing between the Conn and the Ops looking over Worf's shoulder at something on his monitor. Suddenly, the bridge CRACKLES with BLUE LIGHT, knocking Riker off balance...
 Worf and Tasha work furiously to counteract the beams. WE CAN HEAR the steady DRONE of the Enterprise's ENGINES, straining to meet the challenge...
 Wesley and Technicians in background.

 Should we go inside?
 What about you?
 Tell me something, Dixon. When you've gone.... will this world still exist?.. Will my wife and kids still be waiting for me at home?
 Picard steps back out onto the Enterprise. Data hurriedly takes Whalen away. Wesley rushes to Beverly, who hugs him as she follows Data.
 Captain!
 Picard is finishing his greeting. The others on the bridge are holding completely still, praying that nothing goes wrong...
 PULLING OUT of orbit, and HEADING for deep space...
 traveling at high warp against an array of stars.
 Everyone at his regular station with the exception of Data whose station is manned by WESLEY.
 Totally bare except for a quite sophisticated wall computer and a mirror on a tripod which DATA now stands in front of watching himself. He SNEEZES. It is not a good sneeze, comes off rather artificial. Data tries again, harder... but not much better. Then a CHIME and Wesley ENTERS.
 From the Main Viewer WE CAN SEE that the starship is at subwarp now, and a rather BROWNISH LOOKING PLANET IS COMING INTO VIEW in the distance.
 The starship in close orbit of Data's home planet.
 The Away Team of Riker, Data, GEORDI, TASHA and WORF MATERIALIZING on the planet surface. Far from it looking like farmland, the place is barren. They stand for a moment looking around -- Worf is alert to any security problems -- Tasha scans with her tricorder
 as all follow Data's lead.
 Data is leading them to a very undistinguished-looking stone pallet. This and the barren location look to be considerably less than the exciting mystery they have expected.
 Geordi moves to the rock face behind Data's "birth pallet," examining it very closely.
 A curving tunnel. Geordi steps in closer, Riker and Data pressing in next. Geordi reaches out, touching something that suddenly ILLUMINATES the tunnel. Tasha, duty always, steps forward and scans the tunnel. Then to Riker:
 as they continue to an intersecting corridor which features a familiar-looking type of sliding metal door. Geordi again makes a close examination of this, then touches a sensor switch. The sliding door OPENS.
 Similar to some very sophisticated things we've seen on the Enterprise, the lab is filled with equipment and instruments of the most sophisticated twenty-fourth century level. In addition to workbenches, etc. there is a prominent covered worktable which will figure in scenes here. The team ENTERS with Tasha at the lead, weapon in hand -- and with Worf professionally guarding their rear at the door to the corridor they entered from. Riker scans the lab.
 Riker moves to the large, thick laboratory table mentioned earlier. Whatever they've found out about it has lead Riker now to touch a control on it -- and it now hinges apart HUMMING and presenting the torso and head part of a human-shaped mold. Seeing what is happening, Geordi and Data hurry over.

 and REVEALING the "DATA" HEAD as he bends to examine as Data straightens up INTO THE SCENE with them.
 Commander, can this be another me? Or perhaps my brother?
 Picard, Riker, Geordi, Tasha, Worf and Wesley at their regular positions. Tasha is receiving a subspace message, turns now toward Picard.
 We hold on our starship long enough to see it LEAVING orbit of Data's home planet.
 Where Doctor Crusher and CHIEF ENGINEER ARGYLE work with Medical and Engineering Specialists at an advanced type operating table containing the various parts of the unassembled android which was discovered.
 An expression of hope and longing on his face as he watches the medical and engineering people at work on the unassembled android.
 Outside, the passing stars reflect the fact our starship is at warp speed to make up for the delay at Data's planet. On the table, the child's drawing of a strange crystalline shape.

 Beverly pressing further.
 traveling against a background of stars at warp speed.
 Two Data-like forms on two operating tables next to each other. Neither of the Data look-alikes is moving, and the torso of each is all but hidden by the medical scanners over the tables. At one of the tables, the mixed engineering and medical team is gathered. Argyle and Beverly are reaching in, intent on what they are seeing and doing.
 We're unable to tell whether this is Data or the look-alike. Whichever, it is unmoving as Beverly and Argyle lean in to peer closely at what is under the sensor hood.
 Revealing some of a Data-like torso in which a flap has been cut open TO REVEAL a bit of complex android body interior in which WE SEE low-level PURPLE AND GREEN FLICKERING. Argyle's hand is pointing a finger at something.

 A slightly groggy Data at one of the operating tables, finishes slipping into his uniform. Beverly moves INTO SHOT, looks at the other android form, speaking quietly.

 Picard and Data considering the Lore happening.
 Lore is now wearing a plain-colored utility uniform without rank or insignia. It includes pocket-pouches and a turtle-necked kind of undergarment beneath. His only other difference from Data is in the fact he often smiles (perhaps with a suggestion of insincerity), plus his occasional facial "tic" or twitch. He is now seated in Wesley's position at the Helm next to Geordi who is pointing out various controls. Wesley, standing behind that position, and Riker at Command, seem a bit uncertain of this android. The other regulars watch approvingly.
 On the nose!
 Data speaks toward the panel.

 But how did Data escape that thing? Or Lore?
 where Lore has set out a champagne bottle from which he fills stemmed glasses. Then, he pours silver metal bits into one of the glasses, causing the champagne momentarily to FIZZ WITH A SHRILL SOUND. It has hardly settled down when the sliding door OPENS and Data ENTERS. Lore manages to slip the vial into a pouch in his utility uniform as he turns, smiling.
 Only Riker, Geordi, Wesley and Worf on duty now. Worf gets a reading which causes him to look toward Riker.

 Any angles on the Main Viewer SHOW the same high warp speed. The full bridge crew we saw earlier is on duty, Wesley back at the Helm position, Beverly seated in the Command Area again. Data hasn't returned, of course. Picard ENTERS from his Ready Room, reflecting annoyance as he speaks to Wesley.
 MOVING IN to float close to our starship, the SHIMMERING CRYSTAL COMPLEXITY is very obvious. It looks both very lovely and terribly powerful at the same time.

 Data's eyes flicker open, rolling about.
 Again on Data's back -- Lore's fingers jabbing viciously at the "switch" area.
 Data's head begins to jerk about, then begins doing it more and more violently and he begins making PAINED SOUNDS -- then struggles as if to sit up, Lore pretending to hold him down.
 Lore still turned toward the door area, an ugly expression now on Lore's face.

 Steel and glass and concrete, with all the trappings of a Presidential Suite. The Elected One, BEATA, sits behind a huge desk. Dressed in utilitarian fashion, the woman is still very attractive. Hovering over her is TRENT, her personal secretary. He's shorter in stature, much more frail than Beata (as are all the men of this planet). In contrast to his boss, he's dressed in bright colors. Beata is busy scanning and signing papers that Trent places in front of her, when:

 Beverly hovers over Picard with a medical tricorder.
 Geordi and Worf at their stations.
 Riker, Trent with him as escort, stands before Beata who is seated at her desk. Ariel is also present, her business with Beata suspended by:
 Data, Troi and Tasha standing by.
 Set phasers to stun.
 Primitive by the standards we've grown accustomed to on Angel One, but comfortable communal housing nevertheless. Data, Troi and Tasha MATERIALIZE, phasers at the ready. But their vigilance seems the product of over-training as they REACT to the sight of:
 relaxing in a chair. He smiles at the away team.
 In orbit.
 Geordi at Command; Worf at his station. Other crewmembers are scattered about.
 Drawn, weary, listless, Picard huddles under a blanket as he tries to sit at his desk. The man is incredibly ill, his speech halting, broken by coughs and shivers.
 referring to his console at the conn.
 Ramsey, a large, pleasant man, pours drinks for the away team. He's dressed in a subdued version of the male native dress.
 Trent is no longer in the room. Beata and Riker, seated comfortably on a lounge, each have a drink.
 ENTERING with the metallic box. Taking the box:
 Ramsey paces the small place, the away team watching, listening to:
 in orbit.
 SHOOTING from the lab area, WE CAN SEE the room is overflowing with beds of sick crewmembers. A line of newly infected has formed in the doorway. Beverly is busy with her research when:
 Geordi, nursing a stiff neck of his own, listens:
 Data and Troi standing by. Ramsey watching.
 CLOSE ON the Albeni mediation crystal. Beata's hand reaches INTO FRAME, taps the crystal with the striking bar. It GLOWS, HUMS. PAN off the crystal to the lounge where Riker and Beata are wrapped in each other's arms. There are caresses and kisses as counterpoint to:
 as Trent ENTERS the chamber. "Don't kill the messenger" is practically stamped on his forehead.
 Everything normal on the outside.
 Still in bed; still very sick. Door CHIME. Weakly:
 Riker, Tasha and Troi are joined by Data RETURNING from a quiet corner of the hall. Except for our away team, only Trent and a female guard are standing by to make sure no one steals the paperclips. In hushed voices:
 FILING INTO the Hall, taking their seats. Ariel is not among them.
 In orbit.
 Beverly, medical tricorder in hand, is examining Geordi. He looks terrible, feels worse. Otherwise, the bridge is empty.
 Riker stands before the desk, fighting to draw Beata's attention from the stack of paperwork she intentionally hides behind.
 Ramsey, Ariel, and the others sit, stand or lean in the cramped area like ancient Christians awaiting dawn and the inevitable lions. All react to:
 Riker, Data, Troi and Tasha are allowed into the room by a Guard who closes and locks the door behind them.
 This is the Enterprise.
 This is Data, standing by to beam up.
 turning now to look at tomorrow's intended victims.
 A sleepless night has been spent by all. Trent ENTERS.
 I gave you a direct order to head for the Neutral Zone immediately. Explain the delay.
 Lots of folk. Tasha, Troi and Riker. Ramsey and Ariel. Ramsey's merry band of followers. Guards. Beata. The Parliamentarians. Trent. Anyone else we can find and costume. It's hangin' time.
 Our away team waits. They're running out of time. They explore their options. Hey, it's a short scene.
 In orbit.
 Data moves from station to station, checking all is well.
 Her work area shows evidence of much work. Beverly looks tired... but very pleased.
 Our Team listens as:
 Beata, Trent, the away team. Basically, Beata tells Riker he's pretty smart for a man. She's given his words a great deal of thought, sees his point, has (with the help of her parliament) reached a decision.
 Riker, Troi and Tasha MATERIALIZE. Beverly is standing by to inoculate the returning away team.
 Picard is still in bed, but he looks much better than before. DOOR CHIME.
 Data is seated at his usual station. The turbolift doors OPEN and OUT STEP Riker and Tasha, each hurrying to the appropriate station. As Riker takes the center seat.
 the ship breaks out of orbit and heads toward its next adventure as we:
 as the Enterprise moves toward Starbase 74.
 as the Enterprise closes with the huge starbase entrance port.
 The REGULAR CREWMEMBERS are in their accustomed places as:
 as the Enterprise moves into docking position.
 The two elements COME INTO PLACE.
 Docking complete.
 A hatch OPENS to the Starbase and allows the easy passage of people and supplies. There is a RUSH OF AIR as the hatch opens. Then a group of maintenance personnel EMERGE from the far end and CROSS to the Enterprise.
 Picard and Riker greet the starbase personnel. Commander ORFIL QUINTEROS, the base commander, steps forward. TWO other pale, frail people with translucent skin stand nearby. They are the BYNARS.
 as they ENTER.
 Picard and Riker walking along.
 Picard gives their destination.
 CLOSE-UP on two of the Bynars as they pull open a panel. PULL BACK TO REVEAL Riker and Wesley watching them. Other than these four, the bridge is empty. The Bynars' CONVERSATION IS UNINTELLIGIBLE. It's a flow of data based information, which SOUNDS LIKE HIGH-SPEED RADIO MULTIPLEX IN BURSTS. The sound of it, and the movements of the aliens amuses Riker. TWO BYNARS ENTER the bridge and COME hurriedly UP. They are all in a state of agitation. The CONVERSATION goes on AT VERY HIGH SPEED.
 As Riker walks along he sees TASHA, WORF, and some other members of the Crew, at the far end of the corridor. They are dressed for athletics. Each carries a small duffel bag.
 He watches them go for a lonely moment. The area SUDDENLY DARKENS. Riker steps over to the com panel. He touches the panel, which LIGHTS UP, ILLUMINATING HIM.
 He touches the panel.
 Its design and form is to be determined, the artist is Lieutenant Commander Data.
 BEVERLY is picking up notes and notebooks. She's excited almost to the point of being frazzled. Riker ENTERS.
 Two of the Bynars are there working on the outer panel. Riker APPROACHES.
 Riker steps to the entrance. The doors OPEN. Before him is a --
 by pencil spots. Riker's impressed.
 Gentlemen, if this is what you call "enhancement" you have a gift for understatement.
 They CONSPIRE EXCITEDLY among themselves. Then go to the computer panel and make some very specific adjustment, looking at each other seriously for approval.
 As Riker sits down, the IMAGES COME TO LIFE. The combo BEGINS TO PLAY, the woman (Minuet) MOVES.
 The level of excitement among the Bynars increase. They are very pleased with what they have done.
 He looks at her with interest.
 It's clear from his expression and attitude that Riker's reaction is very meaningful. Zero Zero and One One APPROACH the computer panel and make a slight adjustment.
 A slight change occurs in Minuet. The way she looks at Riker is more personal.
 It's working. All we need...
 The Enterprise is still docked.
 Wesley is at the Aft station watching two of the Bynars APPROACHES him.
 Riker is on the bandstand playing with the trio.
 Slips into a short solo.
 Minuet listens, enthralled more by the man than by his music.
 As the PIANO PLAYER takes over, the BASS PLAYER leans over to Riker.
 He looks at Minuet.
 Her eyes are shining and it's all for Riker.
 He tries to defuse the look and his feelings.
 Riker talks to the bass player, but really he's talking to himself.
 Riker APPROACHES the table. Minuet smiles a greeting.
 As they STEP ONTO the dance floor, Minuet turns and folds herself into his arms. They dance. It's slow and sexy.
 Picard is near the entrance taking it all in. The band, the mood, and Riker with a beautiful woman.
 Data and Geordi are still working on his painting which shows signs of change, if not improvement. Data has stopped and is gazing vaguely off in space.
 Wesley's at the aft Science Station. The Bynars are slightly off to one side watching him with great interest.
 The area is quiet. The lights are down. Geordi and Data ENTER. Surprised no one is there. They are looking for anything. As he moves vaguely around, something catches Geordi's extremely efficient eye. His attitude changes. He moves quickly to the COMPUTER and begins working.
 The KLAXON SCREAMS over a SERIES OF SHOTS of the ENTERPRISE BEING EVACUATED.
 People running down the corridors, the KLAXON still BLARING.
 People still running. Over this:
 Those people still aboard on the lower decks are SEEN RUNNING OUT of the connecting ramp into the Starbase.
 Beverly is talking to Doctor Terence Epstein, a young man of twenty-six. She has her notes spread out on a table.
 People are converging, bunching up. INCLUDE Wesley.
 Drawn by the emergency SIRENS and frantic activity around the Enterprise, Tasha and Worf ENTER to see what is happening.
 Data and Geordi are closing down their consoles.
 It is a room about the size of the main bridge. There is a large window through which WE SEE the now "empty" ENTERPRISE as it starts to BACK OUT. Quinteros is in charge of the operation. Enterprise people are ARRIVING. Wesley has joined Worf and Tasha as Data and Geordi BEAM IN.
 The SHIP continues to BACK AWAY from its mooring.
 The ship clears the starbase, turns, and WARPS AWAY, leaving starbase far behind.
 as the members of the Enterprise crew stare at the emptiness which had been their ship.
 at warp speed as it RUSHES ON toward an unknown destination.
 CAMERA ROAMS the decks and corridors. All EMPTY. Warning LIGHTS still continue to FLASH.
 WE COME INTO THE SCENE, as Picard, Riker, and Minuet are talking. Minuet reaches over and lightly touches Riker's arm.
 They react with shock -- like a dousing of ice water.
 Picard and Riker are framed in the doorway, with Minuet, MOTIONLESS, in the background.
 Picard APPROACHES Riker and Minuet. She COMES ALIVE when he speaks to her.
 With Geordi, Data, Tasha, Wesley and Worf.
 Picard and Riker move quickly down a corridor. They turn a corner.
 Picard and Riker ENTER a door. It closes behind them, FILLING THE SCREEN with the words "WEAPONS ROOM."
 as it moves along at warp.
 After a moment, they ENTER the corridor tensely -- armed against the possibility of being met by hostiles. Seeing the corridor is clear, Riker turns one way, Picard another.
 Picard STEPS TO the wall panel and waits a beat as Riker JOINS him. Together they set the auto-destruct which requires their specific genetic code in order to access the system.
 This computer is separate from the main computer and is used for this type of emergency only.
 WE SEE a BLUR OF SYMBOLS indicating a high-speed data flow.
 An enormous amount of data is being received and stored in the main computer.
 Picard and Riker move cautiously forward. The ship is quiet.
 They reach turbolift nine. The doors do not open. Picard punches in a command to bring it. No response. The AUTO-DESTRUCT is DISPLAYED on every com panel. This one now reads "FOUR MINUTES TEN SECONDS."
 Restless, the Enterprise crew is hovering around the Control Center.
 FLIES BY at warp speed.
 They ARRIVE at the Transporter Room. Riker goes to the control panel.
 Picard and Riker BEAM INTO the Main Bridge as programmed -- he forward and port side, Riker aft. They look around, phasers ready.
 In one corner of the bridge, the Bynars are huddled together, pale, cold, almost inert. They seem totally lifeless. All have looks of fear. They clearly pose no threat.
 He relaxes and moves forward.
 near the Bynar's home planet - Bynaus.
 Picard and Riker stand in front of it. The auto-destruct reads "TWO MINUTES, ONE SECOND."
 Picard is by the Bynars who are prone and inert. Riker is checking the ship's position at a nearby panel.
 as he ponders.
 Riker at the Aft station computer with Picard beside him.
 Picard and Riker hurriedly EXIT the turbolift.
 Riker and Picard are in the Holodeck. It's still the JAZZ CLUB. As they APPROACH Minuet she UNFREEZES.
 Riker and Picard ENTER and take their positions. Picard touches his arm panel.
 The relief is instantaneous. (INTERCUT THE ENTERPRISE AND STARBASE AS NEEDED.)
 He sets up the program. The CRT SCREEN DISPLAYS a PATTERN and starts running COMBINATIONS OF ONES AND ZEROS until it gets to -- 11001001 -- then the SCREEN LOCKS.
 In the dim light, Riker and Picard watch as the CRT Screen whips through the files being dumped on Bynaus.
 The ship APPROACHES, then DOCKS. (As before.)
 The crewmembers of the Enterprise watch with elation as their ship REDOCKS.
 Both turbolift doors OPEN and the crew POURS ONTO the bridge. Beverly, Wesley, Geordi, Data, Tasha and Worf ENTER and gather around Riker and Picard.
 Riker is at the computer panel. Riker punches in the code.
 Riker sits down.
 The disappointment etched on his face.
 Riker ENTERS and CROSSES to the Ops position.
 As she heads AWAY.
 The ship is ENTERING a parking orbit of the yellow-ochre, featureless planet.
 PICARD, RIKER, DATA, TROI, TASHA, GEORDI and WORF -- at their respective stations -- all study Velara III on the Main Viewer. As Velara III SETTLES INTO PLACE on the Main Viewer:
 ZOOM IN until WE CAN MAKE OUT the ribbed dome of the Terraforming Station.
 just enough to ESTABLISH that a small alarm bell is ringing, but not enough for a comment.
 Terraform Command has asked us to see how you were getting along.
 We alarm him for some reason.
 While Picard delivers the following, Mandl seems distracted.
 in orbit.
 Riker, Data, Geordi, Troi and Tasha BEAM IN.
 As the away team watches, the screen SHOWS a lifeless, uniformly brown, dead planet.
 with REACTIONS and COMMENTS of the away team. During this, Luisa seems attracted to Riker.
 Malencon is working near a computer screen FILLED with hydraulics plans -- pipes, sprayers, probes, plans for channels, rivers and bays. Geordi STEPS UP beside him.
 They exchange a glance at this behavior.
 as Mandl ENTERS the room.
 She picks up on the tension.
 He steps toward Malencon for emphasis.
 Troi and Riker exchange a glance at this behavior.
 indicating Malencon's computer screen.
 She suddenly registers a severe emotional shock.
 The o.s. LASER BLASTING is LOUDER, accompanied by SHOUTS and CRIES of PAIN by Malencon on the other side of the closed door. ANGLE ADJUSTS as Riker and the group CONVERGE ON the sliding door. Riker tries the handle -- locked. He alone... and then he and Data pull at the handles -- no go. Mandl SQUEEZES UP.
 The central monitoring column, from which laser arms extend and sink laterally into the "surround," has been trashed. On the floor is the equally trashed body of Arthur Malencon.
 as folks CROWD INTO the doorway. Mandl has a look of fear etched across his face. Luisa, very emotional, covers her eyes, turns away. Bensen is sick. Our away team looks from the body on the floor to Mandl back to the body. Tasha stares at Mandl.
 In orbit.
 as before, with Malencon's body. PAN the mess of twisted metal until WE SETTLE on the doorway where Data waits with the others, except for Geordi and Bensen.
 Geordi stands before an array of computer panels examining a display SHOWING the FLOW CHART of the operation, AND a DIAGRAM OF THE CROSSED-HUB LAYOUT as Bensen works some controls, then nods to Geordi.
 Transporter Room, this is Lieutenant Yar. Two to beam up to Sickbay.
 I want to go. We should be with him. Kurt, please come too.
 A localized panel LIGHTS UP. Data pushes buttons. The laser drill begins its normal functioning. Data watches it for a beat as it systematically blasts into the bore holes. He then turns his attention back to the console.
 While Data is preoccupied with the computer program, the firing head on the laser drill, lifts and turns Data who TURNS and DODGES the BLAST which it WHISTLES BY his ear. Again IT FIRES.
 Geordi and Bensen scan the panels. Nothing in here has changed.
 Geordi and Bensen RUN toward Data's location hearing the SOUND of LASER BLASTS. Geordi touches the Communicator.
 The door is closed as Geordi and Bensen RACE TO it.
 Geordi ENTERS, FOLLOWED by Bensen, happy to see Data in good shape.
 He has eyes only for the wreckage that was once sophisticated equipment.
 A year's work destroyed!
 Picard, Tasha and Geordi are staring at a perfectly calm Data. Mandl stands in a corner.
 as they RETURN FROM the Ready Room. Riker, Tasha, Troi and Worf at their stations. BEVERLY is also present.
 DIM interior ILLUMINATION filters in through the translucent dome. Data and Geordi MATERIALIZE among the apparently inert junk. They move cautiously at first, but everything does seem to be inert.
 as Data probes among the junk. Then, eventually, he examines the opening to the tubular tunnel which had been occupied by one of the sensor arms.
 It doesn't last for more than half a second at a time, but something about the size of a rice grain BLINKS several times.
 Unaccustomedly startled, he draws back. He looks around to make sure nothing else is happening. Then, he gets close and looks again. ANOTHER BLINK or two. He scans the little thing with his tricorder. Nothing. Shaking his head, he touches his communicator.
 as Geordi JOINS him. Data indicates the "rice grain," BLINKING in a rapid, non-repetitive pattern, looking like HIGH SPEED MORSE CODE in LIGHTS, with pauses and breaks, like language syntax.
 stunned. He looks down at the FLASHING LIGHT.
 in orbit.
 Beverly is preparing an elaborate scan, its object being the contents of a basketball-sized, transparent bell jar, anchored to a stable base, on a platform under a scanner.
 From the BLINKING CONTENTS OF THE SPHERE, WE RECOGNIZE Data's discovery. The BLINK is rapid, like a visual hum. They crowd around.
 She lowers the overhead device until it covers the bell jar.
 WE SEE A NETWORK of tiny BEAD-LIKE THINGS, connected by a WEB, like the synaptic structure of brain tissue. This structure SPARKLES DAZZLINGLY as energies flow along its "CIRCUITRY." We have isolated about FIVE OR SIX OF THE "BEADS."
 as all react to the sound.
 Picard is already verbally engaged with Mandl. Riker, Troi and Tasha are in the b.g.
 She is lying on her sofa, her arm over her eyes. She wears a tasteful robe. There is a gentle KNOCK on the door. She seems not to hear it.
 Picard, Worf, Tasha, Troi. Other crewmembers filling in for Data and Geordi. The MED SCANNER SCREEN IMAGE is on the Main Viewer. All those who haven't yet seen it are having their minds appropriately blown.
 Data, Geordi, and Beverly are working with the analytical apparatus. Wesley watches. Picard ENTERS. Data and Geordi are peering into the bell jar.
 It's BRIGHTER. The surface starts to OSCILLATE.
 As they move still closer -
 The "rice grain" EMITS a bright LIGHT which fills the lab. Geordi seems almost blinded.
 REACTING to the increasing hum.
 is now completely FILLED WITH a SPARKLING CHAOS. The ROOM LIGHT shows PATTERNED INTENSITY CHANGES.
 Beverly is alarmed.
 The WHITE LIGHT DIMINISHES enough to REVEAL the SINGLE GRAIN HAS BECOME TWO SMALL GRAINS, joined like Siamese twins.
 Only life can replicate itself, Doctor. Inorganic or not, it is alive.
 as it SLIDES CLOSED. Beverly, Data and Geordi look at each other. Picard touches his communicator.
 Riker turns to Worf:
 Because it's trying to communicate with us!
 In orbit.
 Picard, Riker, Worf, Geordi and Troi are at their stations. Other crewmembers fill in at the other posts. Beverly and Data standing by.
 Seated around the table are Mandl, Luisa, and Bensen. Tasha stands at the door and steps aside to permit Picard's and Troi's ENTRANCE as Picard takes control of the room.
 as the bell jar, and whatever is in it, SHIMMERS.
 Data, Geordi, and Worf are working together at the aft Science Stations looking at the same SHIMMERING image. Each tapping keys at consoles, reading info. All eyes are on individual displays.
 Riker responding.
 The ENGINEER, female, and very much into the job, is busy operating the computer. Riker ENTERS.
 On which is clearly seen a very benign LAB INTERIOR.
 On the platform sits the bell jar container, within which is a relatively tranquil globular cluster of Riker touches his communicator.
 Captain, this is Riker.
 Suddenly, a BOLT of LIGHT shoots from the bell jar toward the Medical Lab computer console.
 While the Engineer struggles:
 The full complement, including Mandl, Luisa and Bensen intelligible.
 The beautiful, RADIATING rice ball in the Container, its LIGHTS PULSING IN SYNC with the SOUND. A TIRADE BEGINS, clumsy at first, but unmistakably angry. INTERCUT REACTIONS.
 The bell jar Image FADES, REPLACED by the featureless Velara III.
 scanning the bridge, seeing the consoles LIGHT UP.
 in orbit.
 on the bell jar and the golf ball cluster of "grains" contained within. There is a LIGHT FLICKER from the life-form as:
 Everyone at their stations.
 on Geordi and his console. The COLORS of his panel display are RUNNING UP AND DOWN the visible spectrum.
 Maybe the life-form has reached its own energy limit.
 WE CAN SEE THE bell jar on its pedestal in the Lab. The golf ball cluster of "grains" is BARELY FLICKERING. No rays, no bolts of light.
 EXCLUDING the viewscreen. Riker reads a console.
 Picard, Data and Beverly are with Mandl, Luisa, and Bensen. The lounge viewscreen will eventually put referenced IMAGES ON A SCREEN.
 PULL BACK from Main Viewer to SEE the recently dormant GOLF BALL starting to GLOW again. The GLOW is STEADY and POWERFUL. WE ALSO SEE A QUIVERING of the surface. But then the entire image is SHROUDED in LIGHT, OBSCURING OUR VIEW. The bell jar suddenly RUPTURES. The LIGHT DIMINISHES. Everyone is at their stations. Luisa, Bensen and Mandl are also present.
 as Riker ARRIVES. He opens a wall panel near the door, finds the right switches.
 The golf ball-sized microbrain FLICKERS SLIGHTLY. The LIGHTS GO OUT. In the resulting DARKNESS, all WE CAN SEE is the PULSATING WHITE GLOW of the microbrain.
 All eyes on the Main Viewer. A beat, and:
 The PULSING SLOWS. And seems to get DIMMER at the same time.
 favoring Picard as.
 Riker looks into the darkened lab through the open doorway.
 Riker ENTERS in the DIM LIGHT.
 Picard, Data, Troi, Tasha, Geordi, Worf and Wesley are at their stations.
 in orbit.
 Riker ENTERS the corridor as he is PAGED.
 as Riker HURRIES to the turbolift. HARRY, a smallish ten-year-old boy, runs down the corridor, head down, colliding with Riker.
 From inside the turbolift, Riker watches Dr. Bernard take his son by the hand and lead him back down the corridor as the turbolift doors CLOSE.
 Riker LIMPS OFF the turbolift. PICARD is at the Aft Station. The other CREWMEMBERS are at their positions. BEVERLY is also at the Aft Station.
 REACTING with interest and curiosity.
 All stop.
 There is nothing specifically visible on the Main Viewer, except a SLIGHT BLURRING in the center.
 as the crew puzzles over the unusual effect.
 Suddenly, with a great, low-decibel NOISE like BLANKETED THUNDER, which draws everyone's attention, a huge planet begins to APPEAR on the viewer, clearing until it's visible. It is a LIGHT GREEN, peaceful and inviting, necklaced with a LIGHT FILM. Everyone stands amazed, in awe.
 as she maintains orbit around Aldea.
 Everyone is at stations.
 REACTIONS from the bridge personnel. All are taken aback.
 The away team MATERIALIZES in a spartan, white-walled room with ancient hanging tapestries.
 WESLEY has joined Picard on the bridge.
 The hosts are getting down to business as they all sit around a table laden with food.
 from Riker, Beverly and Troi.
 We sympathize with your situation, Radue. But what you ask is not possible.
 Picard is surprised when the away team abruptly APPEARS on the bridge. As Wesley turns in reaction, a BEAM ENGULFS him and he DISAPPEARS from the bridge. Beverly's anguished face is stunned as she reaches out to the empty place where he was standing.
 HARRY BERNARD DISAPPEARS in front of his classmates. One by one, TWO other CHILDREN DISAPPEAR: ROSE and TARA, eight-year olds.
 MASON, a nine-year old, walking with his parents, DISAPPEARS.
 ALEXANDRA, carrying a stick-em toy in one hand, DISAPPEARS in front of TOYA, her terrified mother.
 where KATIE, a twelve-year-old, playing something that looks like a violin, VANISHES. The instrument she was holding FALLS to the floor.
 Picard sits. Beverly is next to him, like a statue, gripping the chair.
 The crew is in turmoil.
 Wesley stands in the middle of the room with most of the children huddled around him. He watches Harry wander around, looking at the tapestries on the wall, while Alexandra toddles aimlessly.
 Picard stands in front of a table where the children's tense, hostile parents sit with Troi. TOYA stands defiantly, like an Amazon facing the only enemy she can find.
 A spartan area, seemingly empty. Until Alexandra pops her head around a corner. Rashella JUMPS OUT of hiding.
 Picard ENTERS the bridge from the lounge.
 Wesley, Katie and Harry are sitting in the hallway, waiting. Tara COMES OUT of the room with an ALDEAN COUPLE. The woman is holding Tara's hand. Tara looks back at the boys, pleadingly.
 THREE other ADULT ALDEANS are waiting inside. They are all extremely pale and thin.
 Accolan and Leda lead Harry into the Arch.
 Katie.
 still in orbit around Aldea.
 The crew is at their regular posts.
 Duana and Wesley APPEAR in the Teleporting Arch, which has a DISTINCTIVE SOUND. The room is very simple. It doesn't look as advanced as the Enterprise's computer. Wesley looks around, unimpressed. He notices a massive door at the end of the room that looks as though it's never been opened.
 A workshop that's an artist's dream. Tools of every kind, small and large, ancient and modern. Leda is showing Harry the use of an unusual shaped wood-sculpting tool. Harry watches her work with awe. She hands him the tool, and he repeats what she did with only a little difficulty. Leda's pleasure shows in her face. She pats Harry on the shoulder as he continues working. He looks up at her happily.
 Harry and Leda are still ON THE SCREEN.
 Rashella is demonstrating to Alexandra how to use a Plexiglas-type multidimensional set of blocks designed to enhance her reasoning ability. Rashella is thrilled that Alexandra repeats what she's been shown -- and then some. She pushes some buttons and the SHAPES AND COLORS CHANGE. Alexandra GIGGLES and looks to Rashella for approval. Rashella gives her a tight hug, then nods to Garen to take over.
 Alexandra is still ON THE SCREEN.
 Beverly and Picard are ready to be transported.
 Picard and Beverly MATERIALIZE. Rashella and Radue are waiting.
 Duana is at the door as Beverly is BROUGHT IN to see Wesley.
 Picard looks at Beverly questioningly when she ENTERS.
 Picard and Beverly MATERIALIZE on the bridge. Radue immediately APPEARS on the viewscreen.
 is PUSHED OUT OF ORBIT by a great BURST OF VISIBLE ENERGY which envelopes the ship.
 The crewmembers SHUDDER slightly as the Enterprise comes to a quick stop.
 as she travels back towards Aldea at warp nine.
 ESTABLISHING.
 As spartan as the rest of the Aldean quarters. Katie holds an instrument awkwardly in her hands, while Melian uses his pain-ridden hands to show Katie how to use it. The instrument is small and circular, about a foot in diameter. There's a pad for the thumb, and for the fingers. It CHANGES COLORS for each different SOUND.
 Accolan is helping Harry with a wood carving. Harry pushes the sculpting tool along the block of wood and a portion of a dolphin is revealed.
 It COMES out of warp speed.
 as it ENTERS orbit around Aldea.
 The crewmembers are in place.
 Beverly ENTERS from the turbolift.
 Radue and Duana are trying to coax Wesley to eat.
 Leda creams her hands with an ointment as Harry bends over a table, putting the finishing touches on his work.
 She is holding Alexandra, COOING to her. The baby falls asleep in her arms.
 Beverly is feverishly working the computer, trying to make sense out of the disparate information. She shakes her head.
 Alexandra is CRYING.
 It's dark. Wesley slips out of his bed and opens the door. There's no one around. He steps into the ARCH.
 Wesley APPEARS in the Arch. The room is empty. Wesley sits at the console. He WHISPERS his instruction.
 Katie's asleep. An arm reaches over her and shakes her slightly. Katie opens her eyes, startled. Wesley leans over her, finger to his mouth. He WHISPERS.
 Welsey, Harry, Alexandria and Katie, are gathered in Wesley's room. Their VOICES LOW.
 Beverly STEPS OFF the turbolift. She's exhausted.
 The children sit in silence. Leda COMES IN with a tray of food for them.
 Radue APPEARS on the viewscreen.
 where Riker, Tasha and Data wait to beam down.
 Doctor Crusher and I are prepared to conclude these negotiations.
 Energize.
 Tasha, Riker and Data MATERIALIZE. There is no one else around. Riker looks around and motions for the Team to follow him.
 Beverly and Picard are confronted by Radue.
 Picard APPEARS in the Teleport Arch to find Wesley and the others silent and defiant. The children are overjoyed to see the captain.
 As the three officers ENTER the room.
 OPEN ON Beverly - then PAN TO Teleport Arch as Picard and the children STEP FORWARD. Beverly, Radue and Rashella have been joined by Accolan. Beverly looks lovingly at her son.
 They ENTER cautiously. In the center is a shiny black box, not very large. It PULSATES with a GLOWING LIGHT.
 The Enterprise uses a wide angle ENERGY BEAM to "sew up the hole" in the atmosphere. (To be researched and revised.)
 Harry and his father walk hand in hand to Harry's classroom. Harry stops in front of the door.
 The Main Viewer SHOWS the ship finishing its job on the atmosphere.
 at sub-warp speed, it heads for its next adventure.
 A large cake with seventeen BURNING candles is in the center of the table. It says "HAPPY 16TH BIRTHDAY" and touched, embarrassed and -- wants to get out of there.
 Troi hands pieces of cake to Data and Worf.
 Riker, Picard and Beverly say good-bye to Wesley. Beverly reaches out to shake his hand, but Wesley leans over and kisses her. He nods and Tasha works the console and Wesley BEAMS DOWN to Relva 7. A beat, then almost immediately, ADMIRAL GREGORY QUINN and LIEUTENANT COMMANDER DEXTER REMMICK BEAM UP. Quinn is a rugged man in his early sixties. He is accompanied by Remmick, a young, blond, dedicated officer. They step off the platform.
 as it orbits Relva 7.
 Picard and Quinn ENTER. Remmick stands off to the side.
 ESTABLISHING the planet.
 Wesley is the first one to ARRIVE in the high-tech classroom. He looks around the room uncomfortably. There's an impressive array of DEVICES, including a special SENSOR UNIT. He reaches down to inspect it, but puts it back guiltily as OLIANA MIRREN ENTERS. She's a gorgeous eighteen-year-old human, a red-head with sparkle and probably a temper.
 in orbit.
 Riker commands the bridge, with Data and Geordi, Tasha and Worf at their regular stations. Remmick stands over Data, just watching him sit there. Remmick HOLDS A HAND DEVICE which he will carry with him everywhere word.
 Picard is at his desk, star window at his shoulder. The doorbell CHIMES.
 Remmick is waiting for Riker outside the captain's Ready Room.
 ESTABLISHING.
 The four students sit in front of computer readout screens set apart from each other. T'Shanik is the only one who appears calm.
 orbiting Relva 7. ESTABLISHING.
 Riker STEPS OFF the turbolift and APPROACHES Picard.
 Remmick sits at Picard's desk, Riker in front of him.
 Troi calmly faces Remmick.
 Geordi is working on a panel as Remmick questions him.
 It's empty and SILENT. Wesley stares off into the distance, frowning. Worf ENTERS, startling Wesley.
 Picard and Riker are at the Aft Station reviewing supply choices. Remmick stands, watching and making entries.
 It LAUNCHES.
 Jake's at the controls.
 The crew is shocked by Jake's mistake.
 As Jake watches Relva 7 looming closer by the second.
 as it hurtles towards Relva 7.
 Jake's futilely fighting the useless controls. Relva 7 looms even CLOSER on his Viewer.
 ON the Main Viewer, Jake is desolate.
 The planet's COMING CLOSER.
 The crew watches grimly.
 Jake hesitates, then maneuvers the nose of the craft directly at Relva.
 Picard is monitoring Data's console.

 Picard, Riker and the others tensely watch Jake's face. He's pouring sweat.
 Jake starts the engine. WE HEAR IT CATCH as he pulls the shuttle up.
 WE SEE the shuttle angle off the planet's atmosphere.

 Wesley walks down the hall as Oliana is having an intense M.O.S. discussion with Chang outside his office. He's telling her what her point standing is in relation to the other candidates. Chang ENTERS his office, leaving her there looking dejected.

 Wesley sits nervously waiting outside the Testing Room. He closes his eyes and tries to do breathing exercises to keep himself calm. Chang COMES OUT of the Testing Room.
 An ordinary room. White walls, two or three chairs, no windows. Wesley looks around for some guidance as to the next step. He waits a beat, then looks around and decides to sit down. Still nothing.
 Several more O.S. EXPLOSIONS. Wesley runs towards its source. He reaches a door and hears ALARMS RINGING and another EXPLOSION. The door says: "ENVIRONMENTAL MAINTENANCE LABORATORY." He runs down the empty corridor and YELLS.
 Wesley ENTERS cautiously. The door CLOSES behind him. WIND HOWLS through the room, which has been partially trashed by the explosions. It's FREEZING. A large pipe has fractured, allowing fumes of liquid hydrogen (or another gas) and a vortex of wind to act as a barrier between Wesley and the TWO TECHNICIANS.
 Wesley pulls Technician #2 THROUGH THE DOOR INTO the corridor. The door SNAPS SHUT behind him. Chang is standing there, waiting. Wesley's heart is pounding, his adrenaline up.

 Picard strides down the corridor when he runs into Jake Kurland, who takes one look at him and would like to be anywhere else on the Enterprise.
 Wesley stands there, alone and melancholy, staring at the starfield outside the window. Picard ENTERS.
 Picard and Quinn stand next to the platform. The only other person in the room is Tasha, at the controls.
 Picard STEPS OFF the turbolift. He walks to where Wesley sits at the Conn, and stands between Wesley and Data.
 moves off to its next destination, as WE:
 Minimum BRIDGE CREW -- TASHA; GEORDI is at Conn; DATA at Ops; RIKER and PICARD in the Command Position. WORF turns from his Aft Station.
 What is the nature of the disturbance?
 as it warps towards us.
 We are approaching the Neutral Zone.
 The ship comes out of warp speed.
 Everyone is tense and expectant.
 There is a distant ship.
 which displays THE BATRIS. Everyone studies the damaged vessel as the Enterprise moves around it.
 as it slowly APPROACHES the other ship.
 Riker, Data and Geordi have gathered and are preparing to beam over. A check of equipment. Geordi clips on the transmitter for his VISOR.
 as they gather on the Transporter Pad.
 steps slightly to the side.
 Picard on the bridge.
 The other members of the bridge crew as they, too, REACT with astonishment.
 Geordi's VISIONS. (TBD)
 For a moment all else is forgotten as he is consumed by the image on the Main Viewer.
 Geordi chuckles.
 Picard stares at the viewscreen, trying to accomplish in minutes what took Geordi a lifetime to learn.
 Data and Riker are getting impatient with this conversation.
 As the members of the Enterprise move forward, the damage becomes move extensive. They pause at an intersection.
 Picard is standing in front of the Main Viewer.
 Riker steps up beside Geordi.
 They move forward into the DARKENED corridor toward the WHITE GLOW coming from what was the Engineering Section of the Batris.
 as Picard watches Geordi's POV, his IMAGE BREAKS UP, then GOES OUT.
 As the away team COMES to the entrance. All except Data cover up against the heat and INTENSE LIGHT.
 as Picard and the others on the bridge listen to what is happening on the Batris.
 Data makes a sweep with his tricorder.
 as Data walks through the maelstrom.
 They watch Data DISAPPEAR through the wall of heated gases.
 Picard listens.
 Riker and Geordi wait impatiently.
 As Picard listens.
 What Picard saw was Data RETURNING. He pauses halfway across the Engineering compartment.
 They arrive in front of the sealed compartment. The damage here is more severe. Torn pieces of bulkhead block the door to the compartment.
 Data clears the doorway of debris.
 Picard is frustrated at no longer being able to see what's happening to the away team.
 as Data steps closer to the door. With considerable difficulty he wedges one hand in between the sliding door panels. Then slowly he gets the other hand in place. Data, now with both hands in between the door panels, puts his great strength to work again, and slowly pries the doors APART.
 As soon as there is enough of an opening, both Riker and Geordi put their shoulders to the job, and between them all the door is OPENED. Riker STEPS THROUGH.
 As Riker ENTERS the room he sees TWO BLURRED FIGURES. The first steps forward. It's dreamlike. A figure looms out of the DARKNESS. A very tall, very fierce KLINGON.
 Picard REACTS to this new twist.
 Tasha, go to Transporter Room Three. I want you there when the away team returns.
 The Klingon, KORRIS, moves forward to begin formalized greetings.
 as the group hurries through the debris. There is a BOILING, RUMBLING EFFECT on the ship.
 Everyone watches the screen. Worf, from his Science Station where he is monitoring the Batris:
 They come to a bend in the corridor, turn the corner and bump into a solid wall of debris.
 as Lieutenant Yar tries to get a solid fix on the away team.
 The BEAM OUT BEGINS, then STOPS, then TRIES TO START again.
 Tasha shakes her head in frustration, makes an attempt to fine-tune her equipment and tries again.
 A CLOUD BOILS up at the end of the corridor. There is a CRACKLING SOUND, followed by a RUMBLE.
 As it BLOWS UP.
 REACTION to the explosion of the Batris and the concern that the away team may have been lost.
 As the six figures slowly STACK UP on the platform.
 I'll be in Sickbay.
 BEVERLY and her NURSE are working on the most seriously injured Klingon. Riker is slightly off to the side. Data and Geordi have returned to their duties. Picard and Worf ENTER. The two Klingons REACT with surprise at seeing one of their countrymen.
 as Worf and the two Klingons ENTER. In the b.g., Konmel goes directly to the food station. As Worf and Korris APPROACH the table, Konmel orders a Klingon meal - complete with Klingon ale.
 Beverly's aide (Nurse) calls to her.
 The Klingons are finishing their meal. Worf has touched neither his food nor drink.
 Picard is there with Worf, Korris and Konmel.
 as they STEP OVER to the examining table. Korris takes KUNIVAS' head in his hands and turns it toward him. Kunivas opens his eyes and looks up. Korris leans forward and with his thumbs he keeps the dying man's eyes from closing. Korris leans even closer. Worf is drawn to them.
 with Beverly and Picard standing beside him, watching the strange ritual.
 It is intense, and very private. From one of the three, or maybe from all of them, it's difficult to tell, there comes a LOW RUMBLING GROWL as the moment of death approaches. Then -- with a SHUDDER it happens. The wounded man dies. For a beat, Korris continues to stare into the dead man's eyes. Then, like an explosion from the bowels of Valhalla -- the living Klingons, including Worf, throw back their heads and ROAR.
 as they REACT to the ritual.
 The three Klingons, shoulders touching -- faces skyward exaltation of the victorious. Then -- as one, they stop. The looks they exchange between them are the looks of men who have participated in a great and noble victory.
 Both are awed by the ceremony.
 Konmel pauses by the dead Klingon -- as if to say a final farewell. While no one is looking, he removes the spike from his comrade's boot.
 It's QUIET. The three Klingons are content.
 FADE IN:
 ESTABLISHING.
 Worf, Korris and Konmel walk along.
 Other than Worf, the crew is in their usual positions.
 Worf proudly leads Korris and Konmel through, and the two visitors are suitably impressed.
 The usual crew.
 as they stare at the viewer.
 As the image of the Klingon, CAPTAIN K'NERA, APPEARS.
 The three Klingons walk. Korris stops and faces Worf.
 He looks into Korris' eyes. This is a moment of decision for Worf. Then he looks down the corridor.
 as Tasha and her security team edge CLOSER.
 Worf looks at Korris, then glances to the turbolift, which is only two steps away. Korris thinks he has read the thoughts racing through Worf's mind.
 It's a moment of decision, but it's impossible for us to tell which way Worf is going to go, and WE:
 As before -- Worf and the two Klingons; Tasha and her security team. Suddenly, the turbolift doors located between them, OPEN and a mother and her young daughter STEP OFF. As the little girl turns, she almost runs into Korris. The girl FREEZES. The mother is surprised to find the two Klingons standing there. (Worf wears a Starfleet uniform and doesn't evoke the same visceral response.)
 She instantly recognizes how the dynamics of the situation have changed.
 The woman FREEZES. The little girl stands STARING up at Korris.
 Everyone involved -- they can only wait to see what Korris does.
 He glances over at Worf.
 Korris senses, as do we, that Worf will protect the little girl.
 As Tasha watches, Korris slowly reaches down and picks up the little girl. The mother catches her breath. Tasha EDGES FORWARD and touches her communicator.
 The Klingons appear to be going along. None of the tension associated with someone about to make a break or do something violent.
 The Klingons are placed in what serves as the Security Holding Area. A forcefield surrounds the door. Two guards are left outside.
 The tension, which was missing after their capture, returns.
 Picard has his eye on the aft turbolift, as Worf EMERGES and goes to report to him.
 Konmel and Korris construct a Klingon weapon. Each takes off his belt buckle. Korris twists them together. Then each removes the side panels from their boots. These too, fit together and form more of the weapon, which now begins to GLOW. Then Konmel removes the item he took off the dead Klingon. He turns it until it forms into a tube which he attaches to the other pieces and this becomes the barrel. The weapon takes shape. The bracelet which Korris takes from his wrist becomes the muzzle. Konmel's the stock.
 He holds the very deadly looking "phaser" and with a nod of his head, he indicates the forcefield.
 The two security guards immediately realize the forcefield is down.
 The crew REACTS.
 Korris COMES BURSTING around the corner. Those on duty REACT. Korris brandishes his weapon... They BACK OFF, and he CONTINUES THROUGH -- past the Dilithium Crystal Chamber. He PAUSES and looks around for a position of advantage.
 Tasha and her team ENTER cautiously.
 He's found a ladder and is climbing to the second level.
 as she sizes up the situation.
 where Korris is barricaded. The phaser pointing directly at the Di-Crystal Chamber.
 as she looks around to see where Korris is.
 Everyone's uncertain as to what to do next.
 ESTABLISHING.
 as Worf and Picard APPROACH. Tasha has contained the situation and cleared out all but her security force who have been strategically placed.
 As Worf moves up beside the Di-Crystal Chamber, he looks up and sees:
 He's perched on the second level. He has a clear field of fire. Before another could reach him, he could easily take out the Di-Crystal Chamber. He sees Worf.
 He glances over to the ladder and walks toward it. Korris continues to talk.
 He relaxes slightly because now has has an ally.
 as Worf nears the top of the ladder and swings onto the catwalk.
 as he FALLS.
 Tasha and the others START TO MOVE FORWARD.
 He steps over to Korris, leans down and takes the dying Klingon's head in his hands and with his thumbs pries open the eyes. For a long moment he stares into them.
 as they watch the ritual.
 After a beat, he leans back his head and ROARS a warning to those who have gone before. A Klingon warrior is coming -- beware.
 OFF his REACTION.
 Picard and Worf EXIT the turbolift. As Picard takes his Command Chair:
 He REACTS with mild surprise at Worf's statement and looks over at Tasha, who is also surprised.
 Worf pauses for a beat, then replaces the crewman at a Forward Position. As he sits, Worf senses the tension, and hears the SILENCE. He slowly turns and looks back at them.
 Picard, Riker -- and the rest wait for some explanation.
 as the great ship MOVES OFF.
 It's moving through sparkling, black velvet space -- a blue-green planet slowly enlarging in the distant background.
 EVERYONE's at station except Riker and Troi. Riker's at the Aft Station going over some computer readouts.
 The question on their faces.
 A humanoid, THE PEDDLER, APPEARS on the Main Viewer. He has a ROLLING, LILTING VOICE, the confidence of a master salesman with a touch of the carny thrown in.
 FADE IN:
 It's a small clearing in a verdant, overgrown area. Riker, Data and Tasha BEAM IN, and stand apprehensively looking around. The SOUNDS OF LIFE -- BIRDS, INSECTS -- surround them. The away team stands quietly, looking around tensely, and then slowly turning on their tricorders and scanning the periphery, protecting each other with their backs together.
 Picard in his Command position listening to the away team.
 The team moves slowly down the clearing, very alert, and OUT OF SHOT.
 Crumbled high-tech ruins, aged and rusted in spots. The team ENTERS SHOT, Tasha leading. Near the base of a ruin she pulls away some foliage and a melted rod and plank of tritanium ARE SEEN.
 The away team as it SPREADS OUT.
 Picard listening to the SOUNDS OF THEM MOVING THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH.
 ON Riker -- as he looks through the foliage.
 Picard is as surprised as Riker.
 Riker MOVES BACK TO Rice.
 The Image of Captain Rice DISAPPEARS and is REPLACED BY A WEAPON-LIKE OBJECT. IT QUICKLY MOVES several meters away.
 Picard is very concerned.
 Riker and the others set to beam up.
 The BEAM HITS HIM. He STIFFENS -- and BECOMES ENCASED IN A clear, transparent CUBE of material.
 They all HEAR, and REACT to, the SOUND OF THE PHASER BLAST.
 She FIRES ON THE WEAPON AND DESTROYS IT.
 Picard's VOICE is heard.
 Tasha and Data APPROACH him. They touch the cube.
 FADE IN:
 manned as before. The bridge crew is stunned by what has happened to Riker. Picard is on his feet.
 From all those involved.
 He leaves his position and is immediately replaced by ENSIGN LIAN T'SU.

 as he starts for the turbolift. Troi springs to her feet, steps into his path.
 Picard and Beverly MATERIALIZE. Data is scanning Riker and the material encasing him with his tricorder. Tasha, ever security-conscious, keeps a lookout, her phaser in hand. Picard and Beverly APPROACH the cube.
 as Data examines the cube like a diamond cutter looking for the place to make his cut.
 Worf at the Aft station.
 As Data continues working... Tasha scans the area. SUDDENLY, MINOS WEAPON 2 BURSTS THROUGH the jungle foliage. It makes a close pass. It comes closest to Beverly who is startled. She stumbles backward. Data calmly continues working. Tasha takes aim, as Picard moves over next to Beverly. All this happens very quickly -- the reaction instinctive. The team BECOMES SEPARATED.
 as MINOS WEAPON 2 STARTS FIRING. Picard pushes Beverly out of the way.
 As THEY DIVE TO THE SIDE, the ground suddenly gives way under her feet. Beverly FALLS, BEGINS TO SLIDE --
 Beverly and a half ton of sand FALL into a large subterranean cavern. She LANDS HARD AND IS immediately BURIED in rocks, sand, and dust.
 as Picard also FALLS through into the cavern, but manages to land more or less on his feet atop a pile of sand.
 rushing to Beverly's side and frantically digging sand away with his hands to keep her from suffocating.
 The WEAPON darts through the heavy foliage. Tasha has difficulty getting a clean shot. Everything is happening so fast that neither she nor Data have noticed the disappearance of Picard and Beverly.
 She FIRES.
 It anticipates and DODGES OUT OF THE WAY.
 The area.
 as the WEAPON STARTS FIRING from behind some trees.
 She FIRES.
 As it DODGES TASHA'S BLAST, DATA GETS IT. The combined effect works. The WEAPON EXPLODES.
 Data calmly returns to his examination of the casement.
 Picard is beside Beverly. She's nearly unconscious, and in very bad shape, with multiple lacerations. She fights to speak through the intense pain:
 He rips a piece from her smock, finds some sticks and fashions a crude splint.
 Tasha RETURNS.
 Riker has been all but freed from his encasement. He stirs. Data and Tasha are visibly relieved. Data scans him with the tricorder.
 Worf is at Tactical, using everything at his command to scan the planet.
 as the ENTERPRISE IS HIT by something quite unlike a phaser beam. The weapon -- call it an INTERRUPTER -- plays havoc with the ship: WE HEAR A SCREECH as LIGHTS DIM, CONSOLES GO CRAZY, and the BRIDGE VIBRATES as if the ship's shaking itself apart. After a beat, the INTERRUPTER EFFECT ENDS, and bridge systems slowly return to normal.
 as more BRIDGE PERSONNEL ENTER and take up Battle Stations.
 As he grimly ponders his options, WE:

 Geordi's in the Command Chair, Troi next to him, Worf at Tactical, Lian at Conn, Solis at Ops.
 Lian has picked up a reading:

 Picard can't get to her wounds -- he must lift and pull her legs from under the rubble.

 Everyone is very tense.
 Geordi RETURNS to the Command position.
 as the INTERRUPTER EFFECT HITS them again. The moment the EFFECT ENDS --
 FIRING main PHASERS and a spread of PHOTONS simultaneously.
 Worf SLAMS the console in frustration.
 as the BRIDGE IS SHAKEN BY another INTERRUPTER EFFECT, taking the crew by surprise. The EFFECT ENDS.
 as he sits back down in the Command Chair. He's stunned. How do you fight this thing? What should he do next?
 Geordi is silent, desperately trying to come up with a plan. The INTERRUPTER EFFECT HITS again, then ENDS.
 as it dawns on him: they're waiting for orders. The entire crew is looking to him for their next move... and he hasn't got one.
 Everyone on the bridge believes Geordi is about to relinquish his command.
 It's BEING HAMMERED by something which we cannot see.
 Geordi is in the Command position.
 as it WARPS AWAY from the planet.
 Those around Geordi are surprised by this apparent retreat.
 Picard is in the pit looking for something which will provide warmth.
 He clears away roots and earthen debris from around the GLOW. It's a viewscreen -- OFF Picard's REACTION.
 Tasha, Data, and a more revived Riker are searching close to the spot where Picard and Beverly disappeared.
 Picard moves closer to the viewscreen. SUDDENLY, a figure MATERIALIZES beside him. Picard nearly jumps out of his skin.
 It's the Peddler from the opening.
 He steps back and looks up.
 Riker YELLING down the hole and Picard YELLING back.
 Riker, Data and Tasha as they look down the hole.
 as Data FALLS IN, lands on his feet with great force. His android legs absorb the impact.
 Worf and other BRIDGE PERSONNEL take their stations and fire up their consoles. After a beat, Geordi takes the Command position.
 Separation complete, sir.
 It BLASTS INTO WARP EIGHT AND VANISHES.
 as it COMES OUT OF WARP SPEED near the planet Minos.
 Everyone is tense.
 Data is with Picard inspecting the computer. There is a NOISE.
 The DIAGRAM OF THE WORKINGS of the system.
 Riker and Tasha see the weapon MOVING through the foliage and they know there's nothing they can do about it. Riker gives Tasha a look, they both turn to face the weapon. Suddenly, IT STOPS. Right where it is - HANGS in the air for a moment, then DISSOLVES (or if you like... just DROPS to the ground). Riker and Tasha REACT with relief.

 Minos fills the Main Viewer. The image begins to SHIMMER and BLUR as the atmospheric turbulence worsens.
 The STARS ARE STILL VISIBLE, BUT THE BLACKNESS OF SPACE IS DEFINITELY GRAYISH AND OBSCURED. A RED HALO SURROUNDS THE BATTLE CRUISER, the result of air friction upon the ship's shields.
 The Main Viewer shows nothing but a BLUR of motion. The bridge itself is beginning to SHAKE from the TURBULENCE. Geordi MOVES from station to station, brimming with controlled energy.

 The crew calmly but rapidly performs their duties. Riker sits almost immobilized next to Picard. Beverly puts her hand on his arm.
 as it ENTERS orbit around Vagra 2.
 Riker's scared for Troi.
 INCLUDING Worf.
 The team is assembled on the pad when Beverly COMES IN with TWO MEDICAL TECHNICIANS and gear. They MOVE ONTO the pad.
 Vagra 2 is arid, desolate, with very rocky terrain. It's always dusk. The team BEAMS IN about ten meters from the crash site. The shuttle appears to have crashed into a hill. It's almost completely buried, obscured by ROCKS. There is an eerie stillness, a deadness about the place. Tasha takes readings.
 As they near the shuttle, they run into an obstacle - a BLACK, SHINY, VISCOUS MASS lying on the ground.
 They STOP for a beat and look at the slime. Data takes a tricorder reading.
 As she leads the away team around the slick, it MOVES PARALLEL with them so it stays between them and the shuttle. The team STOPS.
 The away team CIRCLES AROUND the other way. And again, the slick stays between them and the shuttle.
 Analysis, Mister Data.
 The slime continues to BLOCK THEIR PATH, BLOCKING ANY WAY THEY TRY TO APPROACH the shuttle.
 It is possible. It possesses two of the requisites for life.
 A SHRIEK is emitted, and the BLACK SHROUD, ARMUS, LIFTS ITSELF off the ground and blocks the away team's path.
 Picard and the others listening.
 as ARMUS FLICKS HIS FINGER, sending an ENERGY FORCE towards Tasha, JERKING HER BACK and SLAMMING HER DOWN to the ground.
 Everything from here on must happen in a blur of action. Beverly and the medical personnel jump to Tasha's side. Riker and Data MOVE BETWEEN the others and BLAST ARMUS with their phasers.

 They BACK AWAY - still FIRING.
 Picard and the others are monitoring.
 Beverly quickly takes a reading. She can't believe the instruments.
 They REACT to the words. Then look back at ARMUS.

 There is a piece of slime on Tasha's face. Beverly digs at it, desperate to remove it.
 The lock on is complete -- the away team is BEAMED UP. Leaving only Armus and the shuttle.

 Picard is out of his seat -- the whole crew is alert.
 The medical team is easing Tasha onto the operating table as Picard ENTERS. Beverly barely glances up at him. He MOVES OFF TO THE SIDE and watches silently, with Data and Riker, as:
 which shows her bodily readings to be totally askew.
 Beverly and the Nurse work together as if they'd done this a hundred times before, attaching the clamshell device onto the bed, over Tasha's body.
 She slowly turns to him.
 Beverly reluctantly pushes in a code on the overbed life support clamshell. She and the others look up at the big diagnostic wall screen and watch all the LIFE FUNCTION INDICATORS FALL TO ZERO. They REACT to the finality of this.
 as ARMUS SLITHERS AND SLIDES close to the shuttle.
 It is greatly damaged. The PILOT, LIEUTENANT BEN PRIETO, is slumped forward, unconscious. Troi tries to move, but is in a great deal of pain. She touches her communicator, but it doesn't work.
 ARMUS has slithered up the shuttle and covered the little bit that isn't buried by rubble.
 Troi is startled. She feels very uncomfortable and looks around, seeing nothing, but feeling -- an intimate sense of evil.
 as it orbits Vagra 2.
 The bridge crew GATHERS around the table.
 Riker, Data, Beverly and Geordi prepare to beam down.
 as the away team BEAMS DOWN near the shuttle, which is lying there, quiescent, waiting for them.
 The away team MAKES ITS WAY, very cautiously, towards ARMUS. The shroud is still on top of the shuttlecraft. Riker and the team take an involuntary STEP BACK when they see this.
 Troi feels the presence of the away team.
 ARMUS SLITHERS OFF the craft and MOVES TOWARDS the away team.
 WESLEY and Worf lean over the Aft console. On the bridge they spot the change -- and again...
 The shroud is half-standing near the team.
 as she APPROACHES it.
 Deanna? Are you all right?
 Beverly relaxes with relief for a moment.
 I'm not sure. Ben's really bad We have to get you out. It has a forcefield preventing us from transporting you.
 Riker makes a reflexive MOVE TOWARD THE SHUTTLE.
 as the away team watches ARMUS surround the shuttle.
 Troi moves. She can feel that he's back.
 ARMUS HAS MOVED OFF THE SHUTTLE AND as it APPROACHES THE GROUP, Riker suddenly feels a great force pull him. He calls out. Data MOVES to help him.
 in orbit around Vagra 2.
 Wesley and Worf working on a solution to the ARMUS energy problem.
 It's as if Troi realizes something else is wrong and feels the pain Riker is in.
 At that moment Picard BEAMS DOWN next to the away team. The team REACTS to Picard's arrival.
 as it SPITS RIKER OUT in front of the away team. He is covered with black slime and we can't tell if he's dead or alive.
 Beverly and Picard lean over the fallen Riker. His skin looks like he received a bad sunburn. She takes readings as Data and Geordi stand slightly back.
 Enterprise, four to beam up.
 Picard APPEARS.

 The captain MATERIALIZES and faces ARMUS.
 Picard moves back a little bit from the shroud. The next actions happen almost simultaneously.
 Ben and Troi begin the BEAM UP.

 As the Enterprise uses PINPOINT PHASER POWER TO completely DESTROY THE SHUTTLE.
 as it LEAVES ORBIT of Vagra 2.
 It is set up as a kind of glade, filled with people who loved Tasha. The bridge crew FILES IN, one by one. Beverly ENTERS first. Troi is pale, and weak, but recovering. She leans on Riker, whose face still shows some effects of the shroud. Geordi and Worf COME IN, followed by Data. Wesley is leading them to their assigned seats.

 What MATERIALIZES is not the people -- but a large cargo barrel.
 Both very surprised.
 Cargo!? Are those people crazy? What could possibly be that important?
 The Ornaran freighter drifts further away toward the planet Brekka.
 Manned as before. Picard can't believe his ears.
 The barrel sits innocently on the transporter pad. Riker and Tasha are astounded.

 Tasha feverishly works the controls.

 On the viewscreen, the freighter Sanction HITS THE ATMOSPHERE.
 Number One!?

 The alien cargo is in the cargo bay. The DOORS OPEN and Riker, Tasha, T'Jon, Romas, Sobi, and Langor ENTER.
 as a free-for-all continues. Sobi and T'Jon grapple, and we HEAR SPARKING NOISES as their electrical fields try to cancel each other out. Romas tries to rush to T'Jon's aid; Langor grabs Romas's arm. More SPARKS. Riker touches a com panel:
 Sobi and Langor are seated at one side of a table, glaring sullenly at T'Jon and Romas who are sitting opposite them. Two security personnel are standing a few feet away. T'Jon and Romas are changing -- they are becoming slightly more frantic; their condition will continue to deteriorate.
 Picard, Riker, Geordi, Data, Troi.
 As before. Riker, Picard, Troi, and Data ENTER. Riker performs introductions:
 The solar flares continue to dance around the Enterprise.
 With a security team guarding the doorway, Beverly scans the four visitors. The Brekkians, Sobi and Langor, seem perfectly healthy. They are relaxed and smiling.
 Picard ENTERS and closes the door behind him.
 Picard STEPS OVER TO the aliens. T'Jon is very nervous and anxious.
 Sobi and Langor are relaxing in their quarters. They have adapted quickly to the creature comforts the Enterprise has to offer. Picard ENTERS.
 Picard, Beverly, Data, Sobi, Langor, two science officers, and a security team are gathered around the barrel of Felicium. Using a strange set of contraptions, a minuscule amount of Felicium is extracted from the barrel.
 T'Jon and Romas prepare to dose themselves as Beverly watches. Each person on Ornara has a device for administering the drug. It's a small cylinder which converts the Felicium into something which is then injected into the fat part of the hand just below the thumb.
 The turbolift doors OPEN and Beverly ENTERS.
 Data is seated working at a computer screen. Picard ENTERS, immediately FOLLOWED BY Riker and Troi.
 Data joins Wesley at the Aft Science Stations.
 Picard, Beverly and Riker are there with the Ornarans. The TRANSMISSION FADES IN AND OUT.
 From Picard and T'Jon.
 His face is serious, intent, introspective.
 As they all stand and consider what to do. Langor APPEARS AT THE DOOR.
 Picard and Beverly are there with Langor and Sobi.
 Sobi, Langor, T'Jon, Romas, Beverly, and Picard are present. The barrel of Felicium is the centerpiece for this gathering, along with the parts which have been fabricated for the Ornaran freighters.
 as the four aliens and the cargo DEMATERIALIZE, leaving Picard and Beverly alone in the cargo bay. Without a word, Picard turns and EXITS. Beverly FOLLOWS.
 as Picard ENTERS. Before the doors close, Beverly also ENTERS. A long beat, then:
 Manned as before. The turbolift doors OPEN; Picard and Beverly STEP OUT ONTO the bridge. Picard takes his chair:
 as it leaves orbit.
 as it streaks through the stars at warp speed.
 It is starkly and simply set up for competitive saber fencing. PICARD and RIKER are dressed in traditional white jumpsuits, gloves, shoes and masks. They stand in the middle of three long lanes about six feet apart. They snap their masks in place.
 THE BRIDGE CREW MOVE TO THEIR STATIONS, returning to normal.
 Picard stands there a beat, hesitant to put in the program.
 Paris in the spring. The BIRDS ARE SINGING, BRILLIANT LIGHT reflects on the outdoor tables of the Cafe Des Artistes. Couples in love complete the ambience.
 Two lovely French girls, just barely nineteen, take the table next to Picard. They are very involved in their own conversation and take no notice of him.

 Picard RUSHES INTO the room, Troi CLOSE BEHIND him.
 Picard sits, trying to understand what his crew members are saying.
 Laura sits patiently near her husband's bedside.
 The starscape glows with a VIOLET HUE through the conference room windows.
 The captain ENTERS and with one deep breath releases some of the postures of command. He moves to a shelving unit in his room and takes a tiny glass figurine off the shelf.

 Beverly is checking Paul's vital signs when he drifts into consciousness. He stares at her intently for a moment.
 Beverly keeps working as Troi talks to her.
 Picard impatiently taps his fingers on the command chair. Data pores over his console as Riker watches.
 Picard ENTERS, not having any idea what he'll find. Beverly gestures to Manheim.
 Geordi is at the controls this time as the three away Team members STEP ONTO the pad. They carry very small, portable respirator packs on their chests.

 The bridge crew holds its own against the assault.
 Laura is at the side of her husband, trying to hold him down, trying to will him to be well. With every assault, he too is assaulted.

 Data touches a wallplate and the LIGHTS GO ON. His eye is immediately attracted to an instrument panel THE CLOCK COUNTS DOWN
 Picard and Troi REACT.
 Geordi reports to Picard.
 The clock shows seven minutes and a few seconds.
 Captain Picard waits on the Enterprise.

 She goes to the first one in the line and touches the hypospray to her neck.

 Data is not satisfied and continues running checks.
 The ball of light moves closer to the Enterprise. It slides along the skin of the ship; then, without damage to the hull, the ball goes inside.
 The corridor is empty. If there were nighttime in space, this would be it. The ship is quiet. The little glow of energy emerges. It pauses as though getting its bearings, then cautiously moves off.
 We FOLLOW the glow as it continues along. The turbolift doors open and TWO CREWMEMBERS exit. The glow blends into the corridor wall and neither crewmember sees it. The glow falls in behind them as they pass.
 At an intersection the crewmembers turn left. The energy again pauses, then continues straight ahead resuming its journey - or is it a search? The energy exits up through the overhead.
 The energy enters. It pauses over the sleeping form of one of the male crewmembers... then moves away.
 The energy enters the room, passing effortlessly through the closed door. It pauses -- again getting its bearings. It has a definite sense of purpose as it moves slowly toward the sleeping form on the far side of the room.
 We recognize COUNSELOR DEANNA TROI. The energy pauses by her head, then LEAVES THE FRAME as it moves down her body. We HOLD on Troi's face. After a beat she turns moment she does not move -- then she looks around the room for the "person" (lover) she knows must be there. There is no one. The room is empty. But she knows that someone or something has been there and that she will never be the same again.

 In the center of the huge cargo bay, a crewmember is assembling a very large containment area which will hold the five hundred and twelve modules.
 Picard comes out of his Ready Room:
 As Picard exits the turbolift, he encounters Wesley.
 As Picard enters he crosses with a CREWMEMBER. The crewmember's reaction tells us very clearly that Picard is not a frequent visitor to Ten-Forward. We FOLLOW Picard as he walks over to the BARTENDER. This is the first time we get to see this wonderful room.
 GUINAN is behind the bar.
 as Picard approaches one of the tables. We can see that DOCTOR KATHERINE PULASKI is talking with someone, but we cannot see with whom. Picard strides purposefully up. Clearly his ire is up.
 We now see that the doctor is with Troi. Picard and Troi exchange looks. Picard senses trouble and moves a step closer.
 Riker, Data, and Worf have assembled. Picard enters with Doctor Pulaski and Troi. As he walks briskly toward his seat.
 We HOLD on Troi as she continues to watch the child moving inside her. The discussion fades from her consciousness.

 Data is finishing up something at Science One.
 The turbolift doors open and Data steps into the corridor. As he turns toward Sickbay he sees Troi, walking with some difficulty. He quickly goes to her aid.
 The Doctor looks up as someone enters.
 It's Troi and Data.
 They enter and Pulaski leads Troi to the bed. Her MEDICAL ASSISTANTS move to prepare for the delivery. Data comes up behind them.

 This is more than just the wondrous act of life. It has as well the added tension of Worf and his security team.

 She is at her desk-top computer terminal as Data enters.
 Troi is standing by the door with the TEACHER (MISS GLADSTONE). They are watching a GROUP OF KIDS playing with a half a dozen puppies. Sitting right in the middle of everything and playing with abandon is IAN, WHO IS NOW ALMOST EIGHT. Troi is enthralled by the actions of her "son."

 Geordi waits as Hester Dealt checks his monitoring equipment, then shakes his head.
 Picard did not expect any. Riker is on his feet and heading for the turbolift.
 Pulaski is running through some medical records.
 Wesley and Guinan are at the bar. Wesley is eating a twenty-fourth century Enterprise version of an ice cream sundae. His mood is much lighter, indicating he has come to some decision regarding his future.
 The turbolift opens and Wesley Crusher comes onto the bridge.
 Hester, Data, Riker are gathered around the monitoring equipment. Geordi is off to one side peering at a distant sector of the containment field. THE INDICATOR LIGHT OF L-SEVEN-THREE CONTINUES TO FLASH.

 The room is very quiet. Pulaski stands.
 Troi reaches out and with cupped hands she collects the LIGHT, cradles it gently and brings it to her. As she holds it close, it makes her face all aglow. Slowly the pain and despair drain away, and through the tears she smiles. The joy she now feels shines from her eyes. The Betazoid within her, embraces the essence of the entity before her and she knows now why he came and what he wanted. Then, in an act of pure love, she releases the glowing energy as she would a dove. For a beat the LIGHT seems reluctant to leave. Then it does. It passes effortlessly through the wall of the ship and away. Troi stares after it for a beat.

 It is moving gracefully at full impulse.
 JEAN-LUC PICARD is in the command chair. TROI is beside him. DATA is at Ops; WESLEY at Conn. Neither Worf nor Riker is on the bridge. Picard appears to be on edge.
 Everywhere there is evidence of a desperate battle, fought on a very primitive level by creatures of consummate rage.
 His eyes blaze with controlled fury as he moves carefully around a semi-demolished wall and peers inside the battle-damaged room. He coils as he hears the eerie sound of a low moan, then cautiously steps forward.
 is a few paces behind. He is very tense as he moves closer to the large Klingon warrior. Riker touches the tear in his uniform and massages the bruise on his shoulder.
 WORF touches RIKER's shoulder, signals him to move to the right. Riker moves off. Worf pauses a beat, then slips away to the left.
 carrying them to the edge of the rubble-cluttered room. Careful not to touch anything, Worf is moving like a panther. He freezes as the CLICKING SOUND OF METAL ON METAL is barely heard. He waves his arm to Riker, motioning him back, then slowly he also backs away painstakingly, trying to fit his toes back into his exact footsteps. We HOLD on these moves a beat and then suddenly:
 spins and looks upward, calls over to Worf.
 A man-sized boulder drops down from overhead. Worf dives to the side as the boulder smashes the ground in the place where he just stood.
 As he rolls catlike to his feet, the massive form of an ALIEN WARRIOR leaps onto his back bringing him back to the ground. The alien raises a club-like weapon over his head and swings down at Worf's head.
 Catches the alien's arm just before the club makes contact and drives him off his feet. He kicks him and follows after him to the other side of the room as:
 turns to face the charge of ANOTHER ALIEN who wields a battle axe and swings it in a deadly arc. Worf ducks under the axe and gets a grip on the alien's arm and they press against each other's strength.
 Worf, grunting in a half-roar, slowly forces the alien back, then with a bellow and a gargantuan heave, Worf throws the alien to the side.
 Worf leaps at the alien who is caught in half-stride. Worf drives his forearm into his opponent's throat and as he becomes limp, drives a double-handed blow to the back of the alien's head. Worf's enemy drops.
 ducks under the alien's club and drives a blow to the lower extremities of his opponent. The attacker doubles over and Riker hits him on the way down. But he no sooner hits the ground than he is back on his feet, charging Riker. Our first officer steps to his side and strikes at the alien as he goes by, heading straight at Worf.
 Worf turns to face the onrushing alien. He thunders out his challenge, picks up the club from the prone alien, swings it at the new rival.
 The alien ducks the blow and swings back.
 about to enter into the fight, then he holds a beat, stops and watches somewhat in awe.
 The alien connects with a savage blow to Worf's body. Worf takes the blow and returns his own.
 as he steps over the alien warrior, roars out his victorious celebration chant, and lifts the club for the final fatal blow. His eyes are on fire. He smashes it down on his opponent, then spins around for a new battle.
 Suddenly a little unsure of Worf's intentions, he backs a step, waits.
 Worf sounds out a new challenge. He scans the room for his next adversary -- he's still coiled and in need of action. Suddenly he swings his club at the wall. Pounding it with rage. Broken bricks and mortar fly. His fury is all consuming. He rips and slashes at everything standing.
 Riker watches -- still concerned. He thought he knew the power and fury of this Klingon. Worf continues to exercise his rage around the room. Anything that stands, hangs, bulges, protrudes, or is suspended, is demolished until there is nothing left to flatten. Nothing left upright except... Worf turns -- his eyes still blaze as they fall upon...
 The only thing left standing. Riker tenses.
 This seems to have no effect on Worf who seems almost out of control. A snarl -- low and vicious -- pushes out of his twisted mouth. He takes a step forward.
 Riker calls more sternly.
 Exit Holodeck.

 Jean-Luc Picard and Riker stand beside Data as he moves his fingers across the console. The SOUND VARIES, SLIDING UP AND DOWN ERRATICALLY IN PITCH AND INTENSITY. Troi stands nearby listening thoughtfully.
 The picture on the Main Viewer shows a field of stars.
 Picard studies the Main Viewer for a beat, then:

 Picard seems to relax a little, leaning back to watch for the reappearance of the stars. Nothing happens and he looks questioningly toward Riker.

 There is a moment of victory.
 The picture of a ship MATERIALIZES on the viewscreen.
 Captain's log, supplemental. We remain like a fly in amber trapped in the void. We have encountered a vessel which appears to be the USS Yamato. All its systems are shown as functioning, yet it seems devoid of life. Commander Riker is leading an away team -- hopefully the answer lies over there.
 Worf steps onto the Transporter Pad. Riker, checking the transporter console, speaks to the TRANSPORTER CHIEF.
 as Riker -- without Worf -- STACKS UP. It looks like the Enterprise, as it should because it is the sister ship -- but the lighting is weird -- and:
 as Riker heads down the corridor -- the lighting here is much darker. Very ominous -- in the shadows -- we see FORMS. Threatening -- again WE HEAR WORF. This time IN PAIN. Riker, without hesitation -- charges forward. Ready to combat whatever attempts to block his path. It looks like a gauntlet of terror.
 moves forward -- phaser ready. Suddenly, in the darkness a large form appears. It's armed and moving toward him. Riker hesitates -- then screams out:
 Picard becomes concerned, as:
 Riker, inspecting the corridor walls closely with his tricorder. Worf, touching his insignia.
 Picard is at his command station, very concerned.

 She takes a moment, apparently considering Picard's question at many levels. Then:
 both intent upon the Main Viewer image, where the star window continues to twinkle.
 where the starfield grows larger.
 as the images try to tempt Picard away from his decision. Troi nods.
 Suddenly, a visage like the bridge crew has never seen! A great human eye is peering in.
 who has leapt down from his bridge level, major phaser in hand as if to protect the rest of the bridge crew. But now facing the strange IMAGE with phaser in hand, Worf seems uncertain what to do next.
 Riker speaks calmly to the security lieutenant.
 where Nagilum still seems to peer in through the Main Viewer. Its eyes now move to Picard.
 Haskell sinks to his knees, moaning in agony... then pitches forward and lies still. Doctor Pulaski has been hurrying toward him, now kneels and checks his vital signs. She uses a power-hypo on him once, twice. Then she shakes her head to Picard.
 Worf has moved in fast too, kneels.
 as Picard turns angrily toward the Main Viewer.
 with the same distant cluster of stars.
 Picard, Riker, Data, Geordi, Troi, Pulaski, and Worf are in conference.
 The door to the turbolift opens. Picard and Riker step out.
 Picard and Riker enter the Engineering Section and move to either side of the console. After a beat, Picard reaches out and places his hand on the panel.

 No one is there! There's a look of astonishment on his face. Except for himself, the cabin is empty.
 There is the familiar starfield on the viewscreen as Picard enters from the turbolift.

 as the doors snap open and DATA comes out, hurries down the corridor toward the Engineering Section. He appears concerned about something.
 as Data hurries in from the corridor to the ASSISTANT ENGINEER, a pert redhead female, who is on duty.
 where GEORDI is making an adjustment on a computer panel. Data enters.
 as Geordi leads Data to an Engine Room corner we haven't seen so far. It is indeed the Victory sitting there, a nearly completed five-foot model of it! Geordi leads Data to it, then kneels and begins putting some finishing touches on the model.
 including Geordi's hands (establishing scale) as he works on it.
 Geordi, Data and model.
 as Geordi stands; indicates model.
 Data and Geordi are in front of the Holodeck entrance, programming the COMPUTER. Geordi (dressed as WATSON) is wearing Victorian trousers, waistcoat and tie, jacket and bowler. Data is dressed in the classic style of SHERLOCK HOLMES.
 The Holodeck doors become a wall of Holmes' sitting room. It's all there. A perfect duplication of Sherlock Holmes' famous sitting room.
 Data surveys the room for authenticity -- Geordi makes a walk around the room, picking up articles and identifying them. He picks up a tie pin.
 Data steps over and picks up the violin.
 as he picks up the bow... begins to play. His music is surprisingly lovely. CAMERA PANS to Geordi as he lowers the pen, impressed.
 Geordi and Data are sitting at a table near the windows. The Enterprise is not moving.
 The great vessel is parked.
 Geordi dressed as Watson, Data as Holmes... and Pulaski in upper class Victorian finery, layers and layers of it. She fans herself with her hand as Data activates the Holodeck console and inputs a sequence...
 The Holodeck doors open, REVEALING Victorian London. They step forward into the street scene. We see the awe on Pulaski's face as she gazes up and down this busy thoroughfare of horse-drawn carts, hansom cabs... There are STREET VENDORS, PENNY POSTMEN, BOBBIES, STREET URCHINS begging for tuppence, BARRISTERS in white wigs, BUSINESSMEN, LADIES, LAMPLIGHTERS, TARTS, SAILORS -- the full panoply of London denizens, all ignoring the sooty fog and sounds that waft through the scene...
 But, Data, what's over here?
 hanging down, with the door lock and the brass plaque just back of it... The plaque reads: "HOME OF THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE"...
 Walking toward them is a florid-faced gentleman (JABEZ WILSON) with a fiery shock of red hair.
 Data indicates the plaque reads: "HOME OF THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE"...
 Out of the corner of his eye, Worf catches a strange reading on his console.
 Data leading them along it, looking for what is going to begin this mystery. Geordi is with him, Pulaski is a step behind. The prostitute comes out of the shadows and approaches Data:
 as they move along the street. The PROSTITUTE motions to a COUPLE of dangerous THUGS, who are eyeballing Data and Geordi, and whisper behind their hands like a couple of thieves who see possible victims. Off to the side, PROFESSOR JAMES MORIARTY stands there as if momentarily dazed by something.
 as the same prostitute notices his odd look.
 As they move through the clutter of the street, Data and Geordi move slightly ahead. Geordi is anxious for the new adventure to begin. Pulaski lags a bit behind.
 Data and Geordi spin around in response to find that Pulaski is gone.
 to the alley entrance.
 which runs along the sidewalk, and to the nearby alley...
 Leading to the alley... The doctor has been carried off by two men. One is tall -- a seaman. The other is shorter, left handed, and employed in a laboratory.
 Data and Geordi (as Holmes and Watson) turn off the street and enter the alley. THEIR FOOTFALLS ECHO... and they stand there, catching their breath, just listening... and WE HEAR OTHER RUNNING FOOTSTEPS AHEAD...
 as Data and Geordi wander out of the alley and along the street. Across from them is a warehouse.
 where a CROWD has gathered in a circle to look at something on the ground...
 of a middle-aged, common-looking man... Now the feet of Data, Geordi, and Lestrade step INTO FRAME, around the body, as:
 Both Geordi and Data are enthralled by this game. Geordi returns to his role as the counterfeit Watson.
 He notices a tall man (Moriarty) entering a warehouse.
 Data has lost interest in the murder.
 Data and Geordi approach. There are a couple of drunken SEAMEN staggering along the sidewalk. Nearby is a very dangerous looking THUG, beyond whom is a vibrantly painted WHORE. A THUG comes up and grabs Data's coat.
 is long, narrow and crammed full of barrels and crates. Data leads them down an aisle following a set of wet footprints.
 As the aisle ends against a blank wall.
 A windowless, doorless room, full of Victorian finery and bric-a-brac... A lab table and boxes full of bizarre tools, equipment, wires... And we:
 As Data -- followed by Geordi -- hurries through the warehouse toward the door.
 Data and Geordi come out of the warehouse. The characters who have been inhabiting the street are more aggressive now than they have been. Data and Geordi are pulled at by TWO WHORES -- by a COUPLE OF BEGGARS out of his way. The Fellini-like scene goes on.
 They arrive at where the exit should be.
 Geordi exits. The doors close.
 as it holds in position.
 PICARD has assembled his staff -- TROI, RIKER, WORF, Data, and Geordi (the latter two still in Victorian costume) -- he is holding Moriarty's sketch of the Enterprise in his hands.
 A windowless, doorless room, full of Victorian finery and bric-a-brac... A blackboard covered with equations surrounding a sketch of the Enterprise... A lab table and boxes full of bizarre tools, equipment, wires... And we:
 Moriarty approaches the table, and pours a cup of tea for Doctor Pulaski. Pulaski has guessed that something is out of whack and her best course of action is to provide as little info as possible.
 They are outside the Holodeck. Picard is dressed in the costume of a Victorian gentleman. Data -- as he has been -- as Sherlock Holmes. Riker; Worf, wearing the costume of a Victorian gentleman, steps off the turbolift... waiting... Riker eyes Picard and Data as they stride up...

 As Picard ENTERS with Data. This room has also changed. Much more of the Holodeck wall is showing. Moriarty is standing by his odd machine. It has changed. On the blackboard, the rough sketch of the Enterprise has been replaced by detailed, colored schematics... Pulaski knows that something has gone wrong, and she's interested to see how this is going to play out.
 Bridge to Holodeck Control. Worf.
 Worf, touching his insignia in order to respond to Riker:

 as Picard eyes the arch and then Moriarty.
 As Picard, back in uniform, enters; Geordi is beside the Victory model. He crosses to where Geordi is examining the model. Geordi has lost some of his normal buoyancy, because he is feeling responsible for what has happened. Picard watches him for a moment.
 as in the distance the other ship, Victory, approaches.
 as it moves through space at impulse speed
 We see the complement of people who normally make up the bridge crew. DATA and WESLEY at the front consoles controlling CONN and OPS. RIKER sits on one side of PICARD at the Command Area, the opposite seat empty, WORF stands near the Science Stations which are manned by n.d. crewmembers.
 An ALERT SIGNAL FLASHES on the screen. The science crewmember looks up to Worf who steps to the panel, checks it and then announces.
 Lines start to form the three dimensions blueprint of a space vehicle, at first very sparse and then filling quickly as more information runs through the computers and information bands run across the lower portion of the screen.
 The three-dimensional schematic slowly revolves around the screen showing all angles of the unidentified craft. An alert RED DOT BLINKS on the interior of part of the live blueprint and a band of continuing detail specifications rolls across the lower portion of the screen.
 He speaks calmly.
 We now see the image of the man, his face slightly turned from the screen and not clearly showing. His joviality continues, and although more subdued, seems to be just as contagious.
 Turns his smile full face to the Main Viewer. He has the look of a hero, the twinkle in the steely blue eyes softening the rugged handsomeness of the man.
 Picard turns to Troi.
 As the Erstwhile creeps closer and closer to its docking berth, the vastness of the surrounding starfield framing it with brilliance as the two contrasting sized crafts seem to float closer and closer.
 With the same crew intact except for Worf. Riker is in his command position. He rises from his position.
 Worf and TWO SECURITY MEN bracket the very feminine and graciously endowed Transporter Commander B.G. Robinson. Everything she has two of are perfectly matched, coordinated, and move with a wonderful grace that is called "woman." B.G. goes through the procedures of the transfer in her usual professional manner.
 The heroic visage of Okona MATERIALIZES and smiles down at the Group assembled. He is dressed in a loose-fitting, open-necked blouse, wide belt and casual looking pants, his look is in opposition to the well-tailored Enterprise crewmembers. His sidearms are also less sophisticated and are tucked into his waistband. The malfunctioning guidance mechanism swings nonchalantly from the burnt-out wires in his grasp. Riker nods to Worf who steps forward.
 Okona and Worf study each other openly, that brief moment of tension when two strong men measure each other. Okona, still with a trace of a smile on his face, diminishes some of the apprehension and gives in to Worf's stature without surrendering..
 Okona stands directly in front of her, leans forward and blocks her view of anything but him. He looks her directly in the eyes, gets her full attention, then slowly and with great gentleness takes a few wayward strands of her hair and tucks it back behind her ear as he speaks softly to her.
 As they watch Okona whispering to B.G., Riker is appreciating the showmanship and charisma of Okona. Geordi, glancing over at the transporter station from time to time and recognizing the situation. Data merely observes all without any reactions. Riker comments:
 Okona reluctantly breaks away from the beautiful B.G. with a laugh and a squeeze of her hand. As he passes Data's inquiring eyes, he comments playfully.
 For the first time Okona is quiet, but then he quickly recovers with a smile and his usual glibness.
 Geordi and Okona handle the damaged mechanism while Wesley works on something in the lower platform of the tube. Wesley can see and hear the conversation. Okona is quite knowledgeable in this field although limited to his particular spacecraft. Geordi is more interested in how he can improve the navigation tool.
 Wesley looks up at Okona with some admiration.
 Data has entered Engineering in time to hear the end of the conversation.
 Okona and the stolid Data walk down the hallway with Data slightly in the lead. Okona keeps peeking at Data but takes a beat or two before he speaks. Then he finally does.
 He stares at Okona with a blank look ignoring the laughter that follows. Okona slowly subsides and stares back at Data.
 The attractive and very sensuous B.G. Robinson who has obviously been expecting his arrival. She returns Okona's smile and steps away from the door to allow him in. The door slides shut behind him.
 His totally confused expression.
 against the background of serenity and stars.
 Riker looks over the shoulder of Wesley and Geordi, and they check and test the contacts of the malfunctioning Okona apparatus.
 The stars in space zoom past the observation windows which span the front of the lounge. Some n.d. crewmembers are at the small tables at the bar. Data is in conversation with GUINAN who is quite patient but about to become brutally honest with him. It is obvious that the conversation has been going on for some time.
 Data is accessing the Holodeck panel. The panel lights array themselves and the VOICE of the Holodeck COMPUTER assists Data in locating his choices.
 The frozen IMAGE of a COMEDIAN popular today stands on a small stage in the center of a spotlight. Data enters.
 The image comes to life. The Comic takes a bow and announces.
 As he goes through his routine of jokes, CAMERA SKIP FRAMES to:
 His eyes blinking in the information at the same speed... Then:
 Data is facing Guinan. He speaks in his usual monotone.
 There is a controlled urgency in the conduct of the bridge as Data enters from the turbolift and moves directly to his station in Ops. Wesley is already in place at Conn and whispers over to Data immediately:
 Okona's ship in tow. Another spacecraft even smaller and more outdated than Okona's approaches. In scale it looks like a P.T. Boat pulling next to the USS Missouri.
 The business on the bridge continues in a relaxed, but expectant manner.
 A few beats, then Data informs them:
 There are a few tense beats, then the face of DEBIN slowly MATERIALIZES on the screen. He is a middle-aged humanoid (perhaps one distinguishing factor to designate him as different). We see a small passenger area, rather than a large bridge.
 The screen fills with the picture of another ship's cockpit area, which is a much smaller variation of a bridge. Humanoid personnel pilot the craft. (There could be a characteristic that would also mark them as an individual race and also slightly different than the Atlec race.) KUSHELL, older and more forceful than his younger better-looking companion BENZAN, steps into focus..
 Worf and TWO SECURITY OFFICERS move through the corridor.
 It slides open to disclose a smiling Okona who is just buttoning up his shirt and preparing to exit. A well-endowed FEMALE CREWMEMBER (not B.G. Robinson) bids him an affectionate farewell. The kiss becomes extended and passion builds again, until interrupted by Worf.
 Worf steps face to face with Okona and sets himself. Okona tightens and seems to coil just a bit in preparation. The two of them face in a stand-off understanding each other. Worf accepts the challenge and declines it at the same time.
 Okona keeps pace with Worf as they enter the turbolift.
 The turbolift door opens and Okona is escorted towards the captain. Worf introduces.
 He swings around in his chair and holds Okona away with his hard-probing look. The rest of the room waits. Picard controls, points to the captain's Ready Room.
 Picard turns directly to Okona. His anger is apparent.
 Okona becomes somewhat wary, but still faces Picard with no fear or nervousness showing.
 For the first time Okona is at a loss for words.
 facing the two tiny and less formidable looking ships. The Erstwhile still in tow and even smaller.
 Picard regards Okona, still is in a no-nonsense mood. Picard turns back to the Main Viewer
 The Main Bridge of the Debin craft appears on screen. Debin standing there gets right down to business.
 All heads turn from the Main Viewer to Okona who attempts to look innocent and therefore looks even more guilty.
 Kushell suddenly appears on a SPLIT SCREEN and yells back at Debin.
 They take seats around the table. Okona takes the opportunity to move to the food slot and concoct a healthy snack.
 Picard moves to the command chair; Riker next to him. Picard takes a breath.
 Geordi and Wesley are still working on the Okona mechanism. Okona looks over their shoulders, admires it. Okona seems distracted, his mind somewhere else, his conversation not up to its usual pace and humor.
 He keeps his gaze on Wesley as his mind works. Geordi interrupts, holds out the new part.
 The smaller cargo ship Erstwhile is still in tow. The position of the Debin and Kushell vessels, the same...
 All stations are manned. Okona enters from the turbolift and waits there as Picard motions to him. Picard turns back to the screen.
 The images of Debin and Yanar on one half, Kushell and Benzan on the other.
 as Debin and Kushell gain knowledge of the incidents involved in both the theft and pregnancy. Kushell is stunned, Debin glad to have it all settled. Benzan is making his statement of fact; Yanar, not pleased at the way it is all coming down. Okona, trying to make them tell the facts; and, Picard, watching the scene unravel to Okona's hopeful design and finding himself becoming involved in the event and starting to appreciate him a little.
 There is a momentary silence as the crew lets its breath out.
 Data engages the panel of controls. Guinan is a semi-reluctant conspirator.
 The Comic sitting FREEZE FRAME as Data had left him. Data steps inside and the Comic comes to life. Data immediately gets down to business.
 He glances over to Guinan for support. She tries to give it to him with a weak nod.
 A SPOTLIGHT beam glares onto a small stage and the Comic steps up for the intro.
 There is a small, dark, smoke-filled New York style nightclub with various n.d. audience sitting at dime-sized tables.
 The SPOTLIGHT glares on and the Comic steps onto the stage for the intro. Guinan stands off to the side at what could be considered the wings.
 The audience laughs at every move and word. Data continues at first confident and then becoming puzzled...
 He stares down at the audience, still unsure as to what they are laughing at. He moves his right hand.
 Bellows out its response.
 Aware now. He lifts his other arm.

 Okona gives Data the thumbs up sign.

 TROI and WORF are waiting. They step onto the platform.
 as the away team STACKS UP.
 A handsome BOY greets the away team, and motions for them to follow him.
 as they reach a vestibule which leads to a larger room. The boy leads them toward a larger room.
 They enter. There is no one in the room. At the far end is a raised dais. The design of the room is geometric -- the decorations eclectic. As the away team looks around, they realize their young guide has disappeared and they are all alone:
 in orbit around the planet Ramatis.
 Riker once again has the Command position.
 The away team in the larger room.
 Slowly, without any apparent signal, HUMANOIDS begin to casually assemble. They enter the room from portals, scattered along the walls, talking quietly among themselves in an unrecognizable, and mostly unheard, language.
 There are three of them... each a distinctive personality and physical archetype -- the SCHOLAR/ARTIST, the WARRIOR/ADONIS, a CULTURED WOMAN. These "types" show no emotion, and if they are aware of the away team, they do not acknowledge them.
 a MAN enters from behind the away team. By his dress, his carriage and his presence he is someone in authority. This is RIVA -- he appears to be around thirty earth years, pleasant looking, with an open friendly countenance.
 as Riva passes them. He pauses, studying first Picard -- his appraisal is open, his gaze penetrating. Because of his vast experience in different and unusual situations, Picard has the wisdom to wait for Riva to make the first move. Riva then turns his attention on Worf, then to Troi, then leaves her with a warm flirtatious smile.
 eeennniYOO.
 Riva takes his place on the dais, the CHORUS gathers in front of him. Riva pauses, comfortable -- relaxed -- very pleasant. His expression is bemused -- as though he is expecting good news.
 He looks the Chorus over, then turns to Troi for advice.
 The away team, now including Riva and his Chorus, move slightly to the side. Worf touches his communicator.

 Riker has the Command Chair, Data is at Ops, Wesley has the Conn. PULASKI and GEORDI are also on the bridge. Riker is anxious to get underway, and relieved when he hears:

 The turbolift opens, Picard leads the others onto the bridge. Worf goes immediately to his position. Riker stands, ready to greet his guest.
 They enter, cross to Riker. Picard begins the introductions.
 The doors open and Troi ushers Riva and the Warrior/Adonis in. This should be very interesting -- the Warrior/Adonis does all the talking, but the eye contact -- the heat -- is totally and completely between Riva and Troi. The Warrior/Adonis is there... but his presence is not felt.
 The members of the Chorus should not be like bumps -- just standing there waiting for Riva to pull their string. They can move. The Warrior/Adonis can get a cup of Fagomerian Tea -- the Woman can be busy with her hands -- doing some twenty-fourth century needlepoint (she could appear disinterested in all of this talk of war). The Scholar/Artist can have a PADD and be working out some equation which is important only to him. Also it is important that the delivery NOT be too stylized or stilted.

 Riva is there with his Chorus -- Worf and Riker, both of whom are carrying phasers.
 Riker, Worf, Riva, and his Chorus MATERIALIZE onto a flattened mountain top... which is the middle of the war zone. The area is battle scarred; devoid of any life or vegetation. Riva looks around the area.
 Geordi has been waiting for this call.
 As before.
 As before.
 Riva is very relaxed. His confidence is high. He continues his survey of the area.
 as he plants one of the torches in the ground and looks out over the battle-scarred land. He scans the horizon. Riker comes up behind him.
 The Warrior/Adonis and Worf light up the torches. Riva has moved to the center of the flattened area.
 Who is Riva?
 Has his hand on his phaser -- ready to take control of the situation.
 He looks at each leader and nods a welcome.
 He gives Riva a sideways look. His eyes never leave the other warrior.
 For him it is the same.
 Riker and Worf are on their guard. This is a very tense situation. The opposing groups eye each other like the natural enemies they are. Each expects the other to break the truce.
 He is stunned. Something is wrong -- something is very wrong!
 The soldiers, feeling the sudden increase in tension -- react instinctively.
 As the away team -- Riva and his Chorus are BEAMED back onto the Enterprise.

 Picard, and his staff are there with Riva. Picard has in his hands the "device" which Riva has been wearing.
 She crosses to them, speaks softly to the captain.
 Picard is there with the Chorus. They have lost their sense of purpose.

 Data is at a computer terminal running programs which depict various forms of signing. Riker comes up behind him.
 Eyes on the computer.
 Troi watches Pulaski put Riva through a series of tests.
 carefully trying to disassemble the device as Troi and Riva enter.
 The CHIME SOUNDS.
 He turns to demonstrate his new ability.
 Picard, Data, Troi, and Riva.
 Riva takes a threatening step towards Picard. Catches himself, signs with a smirk.
 That's too bad. A lot of people are going to die.
 in complete turmoil. Bolts from the room.
 He pauses for a moment. Then gets up:
 Picard finds Riva. He gently touches Riva's shoulder. Riva turns -- he tries weakly to smile.
 in orbit around Solais Five.
 Riva is there with Picard and Data, both of whom are carrying phasers.
 Picard, Riva, and Data MATERIALIZE onto the flattened mountain top... Riva will sign and Data will interpret. Data does not have to sign because Riva, after all, can read lips.
 He moves to the nearest torch and relights it. Then gazes for a moment out over the battlefield.
 Data has lighted another of the torches and is walking toward the third. Riva moves to the middle of the flattened area.
 Go ahead, Data.
 Riva is very relaxed. His confidence is back.
 They move off to the side.

 Riker has the Command Chair -- Picard is not on the bridge.

 Data has the Command Chair.
 FIVE MEMBERS of the Enterprise crew (three men, two women) stand on the transporter pads. Riker and the TRANSPORTER CHIEF O'BRIEN at the control panel. Wesley is off to one side. Riker eyes them with a warmth and with a sense of humor.
 FOUR REPLACEMENTS MATERIALIZE on the pads, among them is ENSIGN MENDON, a large, blue-skinned officer from the planet Benzar. He breathes through a special device at his chest which converts the oxygen level to his use. He is young, alert, quick moving and as the nature of Benzites, he is always ready to please and demonstrate his abilities.
 The new members step off the pad and file through the doorway with nods and smiles. Wesley spots Mendon and reacts.
 He is slightly flustered, embarrassed. He explains:
 Riker steps in to save Wesley any further embarrassment.
 Mendon stops next to Riker to announce.

 as it is zapped by a phaser beam and flashes a burst of light and a change of color. Then another one next to it. The CAMERA PULLS BACK to show Riker and Picard at the firing station, almost back to back and firing at light targets that appear in an arc around them. Picard fires off two blasts of his own phaser. The targets are HIT.
 as it continues its solo, steady and effortless impulse flight.
 Worf and Riker walk and talk. Worf is more animated than usual as he speaks of the Klingon ship and his heritage with a certain pride.
 He looks at Riker, nods solemnly.
 Wesley at his Forward Station of Conn. Data is in Command. All other stations are covered by n.d. crewmembers except for Science One, which is manned by Ensign Mendon.
 Riker sits at a table surrounded by an assortment of dishes. Each one is a little more disgusting than the other. If they are edible it is the surprise of the space age. Riker grimaces as he tests each one in order. Pulaski steps over to look down on his feast. She reaches over to lift something ugly.
 as Picard looks down at the table full of food and covers his reaction. Riker is about to get to his feet. Picard puts a restraining hand on his shoulder.
 Riker moves down the corridor towards the Transporter Room. Worf approaches him. He carefully hands Riker a small electronic device about the size of a Bic lighter. Riker studies it.
 Wesley and an n.d. crewmember at the Forward Stations, the Aft Stations are covered by n.d. crewmembers. Science One is covered by Ensign Mendon, Worf stationed at Tactical. Picard and Data in the Command Area.
 We see the Klingon vessel on viewscreen. Then the fierce and unmerciful face of CAPTAIN KARGAN fills the viewscreen.
 Then the faint glimmer of a red smear appears on the hull of the ship.
 Mendon magnifies the screen and brings the red smear to the forefront. Then he punches in an informational request DIRECT SENSOR BEAM. The screen blinks with SUBSTANCE REQUEST then after a beat answers NOT DETERMINED. Mendon types in an additional request, CATEGORY. The scrolled response appears MICROBIOTIC COLONY... BACTERIAL ANALOG... SUBATOMIC...
 Transporter Chief O'Brien behind the control panel. Riker is already standing on the pad. Picard enters.
 He nods.
 The Klingon vessel Pagh slowly moving away from the Enterprise.
 Picard eyes the main viewscreen. We see the Pagh diminishing in size as it puts more distance between itself and the Enterprise. Data acting as first officer issues the orders.
 He turns to Mendon with a look that could burn holes in your chest.
 alone in space. Its harsher angles and look almost scary against the stillness.
 Everything about this ship is utilitarian and lacks the smooth free-flowing lines and coloring of the Enterprise.
 Riker and his escort enter onto the bridge.
 The Klingon crewmembers watch him, waiting to see his reaction to this challenge.
 Riker eyes the arrogant stance and size of Klag who gives him an insubordinate snort. Riker realizes he has no choice. He deftly, with no advance warning or aggressive motion, swings a two-handed blow with his full strength and lands a monstrous blow across the chest of Klag.
 The sound of the blow against Klag's chest armor echoes through the bridge and is followed by the roar of his breath leaving his body, and then his bulk smashing against the bulkhead and slipping to the ground.
 Kargan applauds with a grunt and a motion of his head.
 My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is how to obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner over that of lieutenant?
 continuing on its solo run at impulse.
 Picard and Data at Command. Worf at Tactical and Mendon at Science One. All other crew personnel are n.d.
 Mendon punches in the various components needed. His screen picks up the schematic of the Enterprise and the designated location of the "unknown substance."
 Commander's log, supplemental, Stardate 42607.8. I have been on the Pagh a short time but long enough to be impressed with the abilities and singlemindedness of the Klingons. I can now see why they have gained the respect of Captain Picard.
 Klingons line the long bench-like table, Riker among them. They are not unfriendly to Riker but they watch him eat like he were on display. A COUPLE OF THE FEMALES, VEKMA one of them, are a little more outgoing and interested. They mumble to each other as they eye Riker. They match Riker in size, maybe even a little bigger.
 He is aware of the attention he is getting and tries to ignore it and simply fall in unnoticed with the rest of the Klingon personnel. His look alone makes that impossible.
 His face as he examines it.
 The two enormous and violent Klingon women as they stare at him and dwarf him with their size and strength. Riker looks at them innocently.
 At impulse. To establish.
 A worried looking Ensign Mendon is explaining to Captain Picard and Data as he points to the science screen in front of him which shows the molecular spectroscopic breakdown of the bacteria.
 Picard issues orders as he moves to his Command Chair. Data is right behind him.
 Riker moves down the corridor with an n.d. crewmember. The VOICE of Captain Kargan comes over the ship's speakers.
 Captain Kargan waits with Klag and the rest of the bridge crew who are functioning in a normal manner. Riker steps onto the bridge. Captain Kargan motions him over.
 Showing the section of the Klingon hull where an apparent haze (and/or bacterial look) surrounds a small hole in the hull.
 Captain Kargan calls out his orders to the crewmembers present.
 The Tactics Officer runs the check on his board. Various information pops up on the screen.
 His face a mask of fury. He screams out.
 at warp speed. The signs of the organism still present on the hull.
 Ensign Mendon works at the Science Station along with another n.d. officer. Mendon is efficient and intent on his assignment. It is obvious that he knows what he's doing. Wesley is relieved from his station and before he leaves he steps over to stand next to Mendon.
 Wesley watches for a beat, then seeing Mendon's growing frustration, he comments:
 He holds for a few beats, confirms seriously:
 The organism's growth is expanding on the hull.
 Captain Kargan and Klag maintain the bridge Command Area.
 He becomes more alert, announces:
 moving through at warp. The organism still present.
 Picard and Data at Command. Wesley and an n.d. at forward positions; Worf, Ensign Mendon, and n.d. crewmembers at the aft command positions.

 He eyes the captain a few beats.

 Ensign Mendon studies his screen and then reacts. He punches in one more code, seems satisfied and then moves from his station towards the captain.
 Mendon stands in front of the captain. He is ill at ease but trying to maintain what he thinks is the proper protocol.
 The tactics officer motions Klag to his station. Klag observes the screen for a few beats then announces:

 Captain Kargan is intent on his own plan of attack.

 returns his look and then observes the apparatus in Riker's hand.
 As Riker steps over to hand it to him, he flips it on.
 Worf at his station suddenly becomes alert. He adjusts a switch and then quickly announces:
 Empty except for Chief O'Brien.
 Worf and Pulaski have just entered.
 Forty thousand.
 Transporter Room, energize.
 The Transporter Chief throws the necessary switches.
 Captain Kargan DEMATERIALIZES in front of the crew. Klag is stunned, then reacts.
 Uncertain, Captain Kargan on the pad. He spins his head around unsure. Then he spots Worf and crouches. Pulaski backs away.
 Pulaski moves forward quickly, shoves Worf aside to examine the prone Captain.
 Klag is still tense.
 Riker steps forward and blocks his view of any of the crew and faces him down.
 The Tactics Officer throws the switch.
 Enterprise in its orbit... The Klingon ship Pagh suddenly appears from nowhere.
 The Pagh appears on the main viewscreen. The bridge crew reacts but still remains professional. Captain Kargan is also present.
 Riker has heard the Enterprise call. It continues:
 The reactions of the crew.
 A tense look slowly becomes a slight smile.
 Captain Kargan steps onto the bridge. He is tentative, unsure. Kargan looks around at the bridge crew who eye him with a kind of disapproval and uncomfortableness that Kargan recognizes. He turns to Riker.
 His confidence returns slightly, the force of his personality taking over.
 He also senses that he must do something more to return Kargan to his proper status. He feels the responsibility for placing Kargan in this situation. He and Klag exchange a look, a very slight nod passes between them, then Riker's look and attitude change to one of open insubordination. He almost sneers at Kargan.
 Kargan recognizes it, roars out in fury, charges at Riker, and swings a devastating blow with his fist.
 Riker is sent skidding across the bridge floor and up against the bulkhead where he lies stunned but aware. Klag steps next to Riker, then turns to face Kargan... Klag's hand reaches down towards his weapon...
 Riker grabs his wrist to restrain him. Klag looks down at bruised but alert Riker who gives Klag an eye signal.
 Kargan fills his chest, glares around the ship, and then at Riker... He holds a beat, then orders Klag:
 the Enterprise assisting the Pagh in repairs.
 Worf and Picard are present to see Riker MATERIALIZE on the pad, bruised but healthy.
 Picard turns to Riker.

 docking at Starbase one-seven-three.
 It's very high tech. PICARD sits alone at a table. Before him is a cup. He suddenly straightens in his chair as a beautiful WOMAN in her late forties enters. She is in a Starfleet uniform which clearly is a surprise to Picard. She is very poised, very professional, and she scans the room as if searching for someone. Her eyes light on Picard; and a funny, ironic little smile curves her lips. Picard rises and walks up to the passway to join her.
 My God, if it isn't Phillipa Louvois, back in uniform.
 Phillipa and Picard standing on the pass-through.
 Riker watches as Picard, Admiral Nakamura, and Maddox BEAM ABOARD. SOUND EFFECT in the b.g. as Nakamura is piped aboard.
 There isn't an officer in Starfleet who wouldn't give his right leg to be where you are -- Captain of the Starship Enterprise. I'm no different. I just have the power to get aboard.
 Bridge. Congratulations on your appointment. Command of a Starbase.
 Admiral on the bridge.
 Everyone seated around the table.
 Admiral Nakamura on the screen. Picard eyes him with some hostility.
 Phillipa at her desk working. Picard enters. She looks up in surprise.
 Data is packing. A handgrip lies open on the desk top. There is a holocube on the top to the clothing. Data triggers it, and a miniature of Tasha Yar stands on the desk. He regards the image for a few seconds, then removes a box from a desk drawer. Opens it and studies his medals. Places it in the case. Finally he lifts an antique bound book. As he replaces the book, Maddox enters. Maddox lifts out the book, finds a marker at the sonnet, looks surprised.
 Captain's log, supplemental. Commander Bruce Maddox, having been thwarted by Data's abrupt resignation from Starfleet is now seeking a legal remedy for his woes. Captain Louvois has requested my presence at those discussions.
 A farewell party is in full swing. Present are Riker, Data, TROI, Wesley, PULASKI, Geordi and Worf. On a table are piled some gaily wrapped gifts. Data is carefully opening the wrapping on a present while people watch.

 Picard is fencing with his usual opponent. Riker enters. Picard continues fencing.
 Picard seated. He has a PADD ready to take notes. Data seated nearby. The travelcase still open on the desk behind them.
 Multiple computers surround Riker. Some screens are filled with legal decisions, others with technical jargon. Riker calls up information on one. Makes a notation on his PADD.
 High-tech room. An amphitheater-like arrangement where spectators can sit. Picard with Data seated at their table. Riker and Maddox to their right at another table. Phillipa enters.
 The lounge is deserted, lights very low creating the implication that it is very late. Picard is seated at a table facing out the windows. An empty glass stands before him. He is turning it, turning it, turning it. His expression is death weary and very sad. GUINAN is at the bar puttering, but never taking her eyes off that solitary figure. Finally she can stand it no longer. Drawing two drinks she slides from behind the bar and crosses to him.
 Everyone in their original positions.
 Reaction shot from Phillipa.
 Data walks to Maddox who is looking confused, guilty and sad.

 Geordi crosses to Wesley.
 The glowing planet is featured on the Main Viewer. Everyone's at their station except Wesley, who is not present. Picard gazes at the image of the planet.
 as TWO FIGURES MATERIALIZE: ANYA, elderly, school-marmish; and SALIA, sixteen, gorgeous, wide-eyed, but regal.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF O'BRIEN stands at the controls. Picard and Riker focus on Salia, who glances around the room, enthusiastically taking in her new environment.
 Picard leads Salia, Anya toward her quarters. Worf and Riker trail.

 Salia gazes at Wesley, fascinated and attracted. She steps away from the entourage and smiles innocently.
 The attraction of her smile is even stronger than the magnet's.

 Wesley is there alone. He is checking himself out in the mirror. The meeting with Salia has suddenly made him very aware of his appearance. The magnet he was sent for is on his desk. The door CHIMES.

 Data is at Command, an n.d. crewmember at Ops and ENSIGN GIBSON at Conn. They all look on in puzzlement as Worf stops in mid-roar and calmly continues speaking to Wesley, who stands beside him at Tactical.
 Salia sits on her bed. The furry animal is nearby.
 Its skin BULGES all over. It TRANSMUTES completely... into Anya, the governess!
 Anya blocks Salia's path to the door.
 Wesley sits with Riker at the bar. GUINAN watches them from behind the bar.
 as he turns and exits, still unsure of how to approach Salia.
 Anya stands on the lower catwalk with Geordi, who is still probing the Deuterium Control Conduit with his violet laser probe. Worf stands behind them, watching.
 Wesley confidently rounds the corner on his way to Salia's quarters. He slows down, a little less confident, as he spots a guard, ARON, outside her door. The closer he gets, the more uneasy he becomes.
 Wesley and Salia stand in front of the food dispenser. He's nervous in her presence and glad to have something mundane to talk about.

 PULASKI is scanning HENNESEY, an unconscious patient as Anya and Worf look on.

 Worf and the monster push against each other's power. Worf is surprised by the monster's increasing strength, it ever so slightly gaining the advantage.

 Reactions around the room. Everyone's stunned at the spectacle. Pulaski moves to check her patient.
 Anya and the guards approach Salia's quarters. The guards remain outside. Anya enters.
 Anya steps in, anxiously glances around for Salia.
 Wesley and Salia stand watching a spectacular display of shooting stars. Both are mesmerized.

 Guinan stands at the table with two dishes of Thalian chocolate mousse. She winks at Wesley and hands them each a dish.
 Salia walks down the corridor, weeping. She wipes at her tears and stares with confusion at her wet hand as if she's never cried before. She increases her pace. Wesley catches up to her.
 Wesley and Salia turn with a start to see Picard and Anya outside the turbolift a few feet away. Behind them are Anya's two guards. Anya eyes Wesley with a burning glare.
 Picard and Wesley.
 Salia and Anya are present. Salia is agitated.

 Riker and Troi flank Picard at his Command Station. Data at Ops, Worf at Tactical and ENSIGN GIBSON is at Conn. Daled Four is on the Main Viewer.
 Yellow, swirling clouds fill the screen.
 Picard and Riker exchange a look. An unwelcome feeling of deja vu all around.
 After a long moment, he walks to the food dispenser. Wesley just stares at it, lost in thoughts of Salia. The DOOR CHIME SOUNDS.
 Salia stands in the doorway. She smiles uncertainly.
 Wesley's heart quickens.
 lost in deep, passionate kisses. Finally, they come up for air.
 SUDDENLY there is a roar... Wesley looks up to see a monster in the doorway. Anya (as the monster) moves into the room.
 Startled... jumps back. He instinctively places his body between the monster and Salia.
 In a frenzy, her eyes full of fire and fury, the monster advances.
 He is stunned. Salia -- the girl of his dreams is a SUDDENLY, they both transform back to human form.
 You should not have disobeyed me.

 Picard and Riker are at their forward stations. Worf is at Tactical, Data has Ops and Ensign Gibson mans Conn.
 Two guards flank the doorway. There is a bluish tinge indicating a forcefield. Worf approaches.
 Salia hears the CHIME.

 PICARD at his desk, scanning a screen of data, schematics of the Galaxy Class starships, as:
 The Ready Room doors open and Picard steps onto the bridge.
 WESLEY, WORF, and TROI are at their stations. RIKER is at Science One with DATA. Picard crosses to his seat.
 The screen displays a majestic view of the approaching USS Yamato, a twin of the Enterprise. Picard and Riker rise and move toward the viewscreen.
 The bridge crew reflexively shield their eyes. The flash subsides, and the viewscreen defaults to a forward view of space and a barrage of fiery objects, hurtling toward the ship. KLAXONS SIGNAL RED ALERT as the objects batter the Enterprise. The ship is pounded (SFX) and shakes violently.
 On the Main Viewer is the Romulan battle cruiser.
 He is interrupted by an UNFAMILIAR FEMALE VOICE. Picard faces the image of the SUB-COMMANDER. She is seated in what we assume to be her command position on the Romulan bridge.

 Riker, Data, Worf, and GEORDI are present. Geordi stands by a screen containing a schematic of the Yamato and a blow-up of the affected engineering section. There is a pulsing red dot in the engine area.
 remaining stationary.
 Picard is standing near his desk, staring at his unactivated console. This is a duty he'd like to skip. He sits down.
 Top of the screen shows a date and time code. Varley is slowly turning an alien-looking device in his hands. It is corroded and appears to be very old.
 Riker is in the Command Chair. Data is at Science One. Picard crosses to the android.
 The image does not fill the entire screen. Next to it are a series of read-outs and a reference to the fact that this is from the Yamato log. Rising into view from the surface of a planet comes the probe. It is spherical, about the size of a beachball. It has a hard, transparent shell and, within it, a deep, translucent blue gel, flecked with bits of reflective material. It stops at "eye-level" and emits a BURST OF CRACKLING, SPIDERY ENERGY directly INTO CAMERA.
 Picard is seated at his desk. There is a CHIME.

 (Log entry will conclude over the fade-in to Engineering.)
 as the Enterprise ENTERS SHOT and assumes orbit. Iconia is a brown and red world. There are few bodies of water. It looks like a dead world.
 Picard, Riker, Data, Wesley and Worf are at their stations.
 Geordi is studying his notes. He has the expression of a man who has made the final leap of logic and put together the puzzle.
 Geordi runs down the corridor heading for the turbolift.
 Geordi enters the turbolift.
 The turbolift comes to a sudden, complete halt. The SCREAMING of the air in the shaft STOPS, and Geordi falls to the floor. Barely a beat... then the lift SCREAMS off in another direction, pinning him against a wall.
 Picard and Riker stand in front of their command positions watching the viewscreen as the probe approaches. Worf leans in tensely over his console ready to key the tractor beam.
 The probe almost on top of the Enterprise. It begins to spit its energy.
 Present are Picard, Riker, Geordi, and Data.
 PULASKI chews out one of her medical staff. Sickbay is a scene of orderly chaos. The single remaining doctor is bouncing between three patients, the readouts on the biobeds are going crazy.
 Geordi and Data (mood lighting if desired).
 Present are Picard, Riker (mood lighting if desired).
 O'Brien behind the console. Tools lie scattered around the transporter, isolinear chips, etc. Picard, Data, and Worf on the platform (mood lighting if desired).
 Riker in the Command Chair with Troi at his side. Wesley is at his station. WILLIAMS is at Tactical, supernumeraries at the other positions (mood lighting if desired).
 The away team is exploring. They have beamed into a dimly lit room. The walls are covered with controls and conduits. Directly across from them is a wall which contains three silver gateways. In the center of the room is a pentagon-shaped "table" about waist high. At the center of the table is a large, softly glowing, translucent blue dome. It is flecked with the same bits of reflective material as the probe. Around the dome, extending to the edge of the table, are countless colored keys. There are also flat screens set in each of the five angles of the table. Each screen is a different geometric shape -- a square, a triangle, an octagon, a pentagon and a rectangle. There is alien script beneath the screens and on certain parts of the control walls. Data is scanning with his tricorder. Worf has his phaser out. Picard just roams the room.
 Troi and Riker are in the Command Chairs. Williams stands tensely at Tactical. Wesley is at Ops. A supernumerary mans Conn.
 Picard and Worf are studying the console. Data comes out of his analysis mode.
 Picard, seated on the floor, cradles Data.
 Access panels are open. The bridge is a complete mess. Still mood lighting. People work at the various stations. Riker is overseeing this last-ditch effort. Worf and Data APPEAR.
 CLOSE UP on Geordi's hands as he runs scans on Data. PULL BACK to reveal Riker watching tensely. The scanner is emitting a steady beeping sound.
 Picard keys in the launch sequence. A LOW HEAVY RUMBLING fills the room. A MECHANICAL, ALIEN-SOUNDING VOICE begins what is obviously a countdown.
 Data!
 Picard is keying the override sequence. The RUMBLING becomes a ROAR. Suddenly the room is shaking. Steam erupts from the console. The countdown continues over this scene.
 A shot of the ship completely dark. Suddenly the lights come up on the vessel.
 Riker walks in like a man with a purpose and hangs over the terminal.
 Sparks are flying off the console. The room is shaking. Steam coming out of the walls. The gate is showing the bridge of the Enterprise. Picard runs for it, but at the last minute it switches to the bridge of the Romulan cruiser. Picard hesitates for an instant, then plunges through just as the globe shatters. Over all of this the countdown continues:
 Taris stands in astonishment as Picard APPEARS. Her bridge is a disaster. Sparks off some of the consoles, etc. Two Romulan crewmembers with phasers move in on Picard. Over all there is a HOWLING KLAXON and lights flashing. A MONOTONOUS VOICE announces:
 I've lost him!
 You did this.
 Picard BEAMS IN and plunges off the platform. Reaches over the console and hits the com:

 The bellboy moves off to the side -- he's young and scared, but he's not the kind to back down. (All of this has to be played through the eyes of Riker and Worf.)
 He looks from the bellboy to Mikey D.
 He smiles. His hand also moves.
 Worf smells a firefight coming and his hand goes to his phaser. With a look, Riker tells Worf to stay out of this.
 As the bellboy moves toward the door... Mikey D makes a little circling move -- just enough to get the angle. Without warning -- Mikey D pulls his gun and fires. It's loud and smoky. The bellboy falls. Mikey D quickly turns his attention on the room.

 RIKER has cleared a space on his desk and set up a little work station. He has a bowl and several strange-looking eggs. Some smaller containers with other ingredients and condiments for what appears to be an omelet. He breaks the last egg into the bowl and whips them with a jerry-rigged whisk. He is obviously enjoying himself. The CHIME SOUNDS.
 Riker sets up the "Bunsen-type burner," ignites it, heats the pan and pours in the beaten eggs, while Data watches.

 The doors have been opened. The shuttle, held firmly by the tractor beam, is being pulled toward the Enterprise, as Riker and Worf ENTER.

 As Riker and Worf move closer, Doctor Pulaski ENTERS the Shuttle Bay with an assistant.

 The crewmembers get the door open. Pulaski starts to enter, then freezes. Pulaski calls out:
 The urgency in her voice sends Riker and Worf quickly around to the other side of the shuttle where:
 Pulaski steps back to allow Riker to look in.
 Instantly he understands the reason for Pulaski's reaction.
 Slumped over the controls is CAPTAIN JEAN-LUC PICARD. Unconscious, but otherwise exactly the same as the man we just left on the bridge!
 Picard and Data ENTER. Pulaski is in the shuttle checking P2's condition. The tension level in the room is very high. Without being called, TROI instinctively ENTERS the Shuttle Bay.

 tries to scream, but no sound comes. As he looks around, his movements have a strange stuttering quality.
 He reacts to seeing himself as he has never felt, nor ever thought he would feel, out of control and impotent.
 She moves to comfort P2, but his flaying hands hold her off. His movements come in a series of stutters. He's here - in this Sickbay, on this ship, but if as though he were in another dimension as well.
 Troi is close beside him. They watch as:
 He pushes in his herky-jerky way against an unseen wall behind which he is imprisoned. His mouth is open -- but still there is no sound.
 The terror of seeing himself in such a condition. A little sound comes from him... It's primal, in response to what he sees and the anguish he feels from his otherself's helpless condition.
 Pulaski responds to seeing a patient in this condition, steps up to touch the hypospray to P2's neck.
 If P2 is aware of his surroundings, it would be impossible to tell. But clearly he is in some kind of horror chamber, from which he cannot escape.
 Riker is there with Picard, Data, Geordi, Worf and Troi. Pulaski is still in Sickbay with P2.
 Picard stands.
 He inputs the computer pad in front of him.
 An image appears on the viewscreen. It's slightly distorted.
 watches transfixed.
 It's the shuttle's on-board camera. As the shuttle doors open, we see that the Enterprise is surrounded by a maelstrom of energy - a chaos of swirling, violent colors.
 Here in the Observation Lounge, his face shows the same concern.
 as the shuttle slowly leaves -- then quickly accelerates away until we see the Enterprise from the point of view of the shuttlecraft. It is surrounded by a swirling cacophony of energy and colors. It's like being on the edge of a great whirlpool. There is a lot of buffeting -- both the shuttle and the Enterprise are being thrown about.
 He is very intent on the scene before him.
 The turmoil around the Enterprise increases. Then, without a sound... the Enterprise is literally torn apart, by a great, yet unseen force. Right on the screen -- before their eyes -- the ship is destroyed. Then the screen goes blank.
 Picard turns away from the screen.
 There is a long pause as those in the room try to absorb and comprehend what they have just seen.
 Riker, Worf ENTER and take their positions.
 Data is there with Geordi.
 Pulaski is doing further tests on P2, as Picard ENTERS with Troi.
 It continues on course.
 Everyone is at his station except for Data.
 Picard ENTERS. (He pauses at the doorway and watches Pulaski and P2).
 He leans forward. Like a sailor straining against the fog, then with a grimace made up of frustration and rage, he turns away. For the first time we hear a sound from his lips. It's strange -- otherworldish.
 Picard takes a step forward. For a second it looks as if Picard is going to grab P2 and shake him. But he only glares at him.

 There is a surge of power as the Enterprise attempts to pull free. Then nothing.
 But the Enterprise doesn't stop -- it instantly seems to fall -- drawn along the beam of energy by an irresistible force.
 They have no control. Without having to be told, Geordi instantly tries to stop the Enterprise. His fingers fly over the controls.
 Warp engines re-engage. The Enterprise slows, then stops.
 It's a little calmer, but still very tense.
 The probe leaves the Enterprise.
 As they watch the Main Viewer -- as it reaches the vortex -- it explodes. Nothing is left.
 A little tongue of energy speeds up toward the Enterprise. Then splits, with half going to separate parts of the ship.
 They see it racing toward them. The energy goes directly at Captain Picard and knocks him down.
 A similar piece of energy leaps into the room, directly at P2... only it does not slap him to the deck. As Pulaski watches it whirls around P2, like a wreath, then disappears.
 Riker helps Picard to his feet. There is fire in Picard's eyes.
 Another sliver of energy slashes across the bridge and slams Picard up against the bulkhead.

 Wesley ENTERS. He checks slightly when he sees this array of brass all staring at him.
 Data is running scans at Science One. The area around his feet is cluttered with a CRT screen, a panel at his feet is open, and a circuit board is out. Worf steps gingerly through the mess.
 Troi and Riker are walking together. They cross an intersection, and Wesley spots them. He runs to catch up, a PADD gripped hard in one hand.

 Data's desk is cluttered with the black boxes which are boosting and filtering his experimental scans. There is a keyboard. Data is fiddling with his equipment when suddenly there is a signal.

 O'BRIEN is behind the console as Data and Riker ENTER.
 Data MATERIALIZES. A lurid red light is filtering through the hexagonal cells of the comb-like room. The transmitter lies on the floor. Occasional tremors shake the room. On one side of the room is a raised platform covered with tumbled furs. In one corner is propped a lute-like instrument. Brightly colored ribbons hang from the neck. On one wall hang a number of pictures. They are all of improbable ships sailing through the stars or winged creatures flying through stars, ringed planets, etc. All the detritus of childhood, but no child.
 Data and Sarjenka MATERIALIZE. O'Brien gapes at the alien. Sarjenka edges nervously sideways and slides her hand into Data's.
 Riker, Picard, Troi, Wesley and Worf are all at their accustomed places. A supernumerary at Ops. The planet is on the main viewscreen.

 Data and Sarjenka cross the room and enter. Pulaski is seated at her desk. On the desk are some collectibles, among them the Elanin Singer Stone.
 Data and Pulaski lead Sarjenka to the biobed, and Data boosts her up. Pulaski gives her a hypospray, and the little girl is out. Pulaski begins studying the readouts over the bed.
 Data MATERIALIZES. He is carrying Sarjenka. (Stunt double if necessary.) Data carries the sleeping child to her bed and tucks her in. He then opens his hand, revealing the Elanin stone. It is silent. He then presses it into her hand, gently folding the fingers around the crystal. It begins to sing. He crosses to the wall and opens it, revealing the now quiet volcano. There are anxious VOICES OFF STAGE. Data quickly closes the wall, hurries to the center of the room, touches his insignia and DEMATERIALIZES.

 Riker is in the command position. Worf is at his station. Supernumeraries at Conn and Ops. Wesley ENTERS and starts to cross to his station. Riker motions to him, and Wesley joins him at the command station. He nods toward the first officer's chair.
 There is a CHIME. Picard looks up from book. In the background music is softly playing.
 Moving away at ways speed
 The Enterprise as it is traveling at impulse speed.
 GEORDI is coming down the corridor, he sees a young twenty five to twenty eight year old ensign -- who has newly arrived on the Enterprise. She is very energetic, and enthusiastic in an open and ingenuous way, which is both appealing and refreshing. Her name is SONYA. She is standing in front of a food dispenser panel.
 The cup full of chocolate hits him right in the chest.
 For a moment everyone freezes. Geordi starts forward.
 First impressions right. Isn't that what they say -- first impressions are the most important.
 Picard walks past a crewman -- who notices the stain on his uniform, but quickly averts his eyes so as not to embarrass the captain. Picard turns and enters the turbolift.
 The doors close.
 Picard is not in a corridor of the Enterprise -- he's on a shuttle! He turns around and the turbolift doors are gone.
 He looks up. There is a crewman at the controls.
 It's Q.
 Reacts.
 Picard moves closer to Q.
 The Enterprise moving along at impulse speed.
 Geordi and Sonya are walking to Ten-Forward. She is in a clean uniform.
 GUINAN is behind the bar. There are a few n.d. crewmembers scattered around the room. The only one of our regulars in Ten-Forward is Geordi, who is sitting at a table by the window with Sonya they are engaged in a very animated conversation.
 Something gives her pause -- like a whisper only she can hear. She is thoughtful for a beat...
 Guinan steps out from behind the bar and crosses to the center of the room.
 She stands near Geordi's table for a beat and gazing out at space. In the background Geordi continues his conversation with Sonya.
 Her brow knits -- like she has just seen the first indications of a coming storm. She steps to a communications panel.
 Who reacts to the unusual call.
 A thoughtful Guinan responding.
 Picard is in the shuttlecraft -- with Q. Picard adjusts a control; Q smiles.
 Guinan steps up to near the table occupied by Geordi and Sonya and looks out at the stars.
 The turbolift doors open and TROI enters. There is a sense of foreboding in the timing of her arrival. Reaction from Riker. Troi crosses to her position.
 Computer -- locate Captain Picard.
 Runs a check on his security panel.
 The Enterprise comes to a complete stop.
 For a beat everyone is silent... waiting.
 He makes some rapid calculations.
 The Enterprise pulls out of frame.
 Another angle as the Enterprise approaches from a long distance.
 The situation has gone from tense to desperate.
 He inputs the necessary information.
 As before with Picard and Q. Picard attempts to power up the shuttle. All systems are inoperative.
 We pull back to reveal Picard and Q, now sitting in Ten- Forward.
 She reacts to the sudden appearance of Q and the captain.
 Who is studying his board.
 The Enterprise is at a dead stop.
 Picard and Q are seated by one of the front windows. Guinan comes over. Q immediately stands and backs off like a man about to be physically attacked.
 Riker and Worf stride across Ten-Forward, to join them.
 The Enterprise is struck by a great surge of energy and streaks off.
 Picard and the others react to the blur of stars streaking past. It's a velocity beyond the capabilities of the Enterprise.
 Data has command of the bridge. Everyone reacts to the sudden burst of speed.
 The Enterprise comes out of the spin and stops.
 The motion has stopped.
 The Enterprise is moving through this new section of the galaxy.
 Everyone is in their place.
 A strange ship approaches -- it's unlike anything we have seen.
 As the great Borg ship approaches the Enterprise. Then stops.
 Guinan is looking out at the Borg ship.
 As before -- everyone watching the viewscreen.
 Guinan moves into her small office.
 SUDDENLY a strange creature appears -- it's a BORG. It is a biped -- a cyborg. Part organic and part artificial. There is a metal like device implanted in its head. One arm is artificial with a tool like contraption instead of a hand. The other organic except for the hand. Its eyes are artificial. Its presence triggers RED ALERT.
 Off Picard's reaction as he and Worf exit.
 The Enterprise in this new section of the galaxy -- with the Borg ship nearby.
 Picard, Worf, and security team enter. The Borg is still making a visual survey of the room. It seems to look right through or pass the people as if they are of no consequence.
 He steps closer to the Borg. He holds up his open hand.
 Picard tries to defuse this situation.
 Worf pulls out his phaser. Worf fires -- the stun setting means nothing.
 The phaser hit has no affect on the Borg. He, or it, steps to the com panel and affixes the apparatus on his arm to the computer. SUDDENLY there is a drain on all systems. The lights dim.
 Worf adjusts his phaser and fires again.
 This phaser hit rips into the Borg knocking him away. Before anyone can react -- another Borg materializes. Worf and the others assume a defensive posture. The second Borg picks up where the first one left off.
 fires his phaser.
 This Borg responds differently. The hit is absorbed. He is apparently surrounded with a force field of some kind. This Borg goes to the back panel. He accesses the computer -- drains it.
 An abbreviated staff has been assembled; Riker, Data, Picard and Troi.
 The image on the viewscreen is of the interior of the Borg ship. Not the bridge, because they don't have one. It is a great chamber with stacks and stacks of slots in which are individual Borg. We can see over a thousand of them, but the ship probably holds more. Some of them are making small controlled movements, otherwise they would appear to be at rest.
 Picard steps forward.
 An energy beam from the Borg ship holds the Enterprise.
 Picard and the others take their positions.
 As he inputs the information and attempts to take the Enterprise out of danger.
 The pin-point phasers from the Enterprise hit into the Borg ship. But the force holding the Enterprise does not release.
 As before.
 The Enterprise and the Borg ship. Another beam leaves the Borg ship and makes contact with the Enterprise.
 A CLOSER ANGLE as the Borg ship cores out a piece of the Enterprise hull.
 As before.
 The beam has cut away a section of the Enterprise and is now taking it back to the Borg ship.
 As before.
 The phaser blasts rip again and again into the Borg ship - the beam holding the section of the Enterprise disappears into the Borg ship. Another volley from the Enterprise pounds the Borg ship.
 On the screen we see the battered image of the Borg ship. RED ALERT ends.
 Guinan is still there as they enter. Riker -- Data - Picard
 The tension level is high. Sonya is a little dazed, but at her duties like any well trained Academy graduate. She and Geordi.
 The Borg is the ultimate user, with the result that they are unlike any threat your Federation has ever faced. They have no interest in political conquest it. They simply want your ship identified it as something they can consume and use.
 They are quiet for a beat.
 The Enterprise, still near the severely damaged Borg ship.
 Riker, Worf and Data enter. All are wearing phasers.
 The away team materializes in the great open center of the Borg ship. All around there is some evidence of battle damage. The design of the interior is as functional as the exterior. There is no attempt at eye pleasing colors.
 The away team looks around. The Borg closest to them are alive. The away team instantly assumes a defensive position -- expecting the Borg to repel them. But the Borg do not move.
 Our readings were incorrect... the Borg crew survived, but they are in a kind of stasis.
 As the away team moves down the corridor they pass strange pieces of equipment but nothing which is familiar.
 Steps over to examine an empty Borg slot.
 Like a juggernaut which could start moving at any moment.
 To show the relationship between the away team, and the immense ship.
 Picard is watching the Borg ship on the Main Viewer.
 As the away team comes into another chamber. There are no walls, or doors as such. This ship lacks the compartmentalization which we are used to. The corridor will simply open onto a wider area.
 Riker moves to the other side of the room. Here are smaller horizontal slots which contain smaller -- younger -- Borg. The "children" are in various stages of "assembly".
 Riker and Worf quickly cross to Data. They look at a damaged portion of the ship.
 As the away team stacks up.
 The Enterprise streaks away -- leaving the visibly battered Borg vessel in its wake.
 There is relief that they are putting some distance between themselves and the Borg.
 As before.
 We can see the Borg ship coming toward us.
 Geordi is by the pool table. Sonya is in the b.g.

 The Enterprise travelling at warp.
 Riker has the bridge. Data is at OPS, Worf at Tactical. Supernumeraries at the other stations. Worf is not feeling well, but trying to hide it. Klingons don't get sick. But as Riker and Data continue their casual desultory conversation, Worf's faintness increases.
 Worf is on a biobed. Pulaski is running a tricorder over him, and comparing the hand held readouts to the overhead display.
 Picard is seated at his desk thoughtfully knuckling his chin as he studies the computer screen. This thing has gotten under his skin, and all his scholarly instincts are engaged. He is going to find the answer.
 He's in no danger. Worf was observing a Klingon ritual involving fasting, and he didn't take into account that you need to decrease physical activity as you decrease caloric intake. Pulaski out.
 Picard resumes his research. There is a CHIME.

 She is working. Suddenly Worf is in the doorway carrying a tray set with two delicate, yet spartan cups, a stone tea pot and a thorn-covered branch with a single blossom midway up the branch. (The thorns need to look like curving hooks.)
 Throwing out spectacular flares. We trace one of these tongues of fire as it seems to almost touch a planet.

 In orbit around the planet.
 Present are Picard, Troi, Worf and Data. Supernumerary at CONN.
 O'BRIEN, his eyes bugging out of his head regards the Bringloidi refugees, and DANILO complete with their livestock, who are climbing off the transporter platform.
 FADE IN:
 Picard and Worf are hustling down the corridor. The Transporter Room doors open, and a terrified chicken comes clucking and weaving its way into the corridor. (Worf presses himself against the corridor wall. It's the elephant and the mouse.) The doors open again, and out comes a SMALL GIRL who gathers up the hen, and carries her back into the Transporter Room. Worf and Picard exchange glances, and follow the child and the livestock into the Transporter Room.
 It is a scene of chaos. Straw, feathers and animal droppings litter the platform, and spill out onto the floor. An older man, DANILO ODELL, dressed in boots, homespun pants and a handknit sweater, and holding a flask, is directing traffic and bending O'Brien's ear. People, all holding some kind of livestock (crates of chickens, a lamb, a piglet), are milling around the Transporter Room. (A second wave of Bringloidi, with Riker among them, are climbing off the transporter platform.) O'Brien stares in consternation at a goat on a lead which is sniffing at his pants, and tries to respond to Danilo.
 Er... fine, and then Mister Worf can show you the ship.
 You're sure?
 Present are Picard, Riker, Worf and Pulaski.
 Outside of the cargo hold. TWO SECURITY MEN are already there as Worf, Picard and Riker arrive.
 People are milling about, subdued, frightened chatter fills the hold.
 She is very like a Klingon woman, Captain.
 racing along at warp speed.
 Pulaski is treating an ancient Bringloidi. Riker and Brenna ENTER. Pulaski runs a device over the OLD MAN'S arm, and cures his crippling rheumatoid arthritis. His claw-like hand relaxes and he experimentally wiggles the fingers. Brenna is amazed. This is magic. The old man is so pleased with this new mobility that as Pulaski turns away to replace the device he leans off the biobed, and pinches her on the ass. Pulaski calmly swats his hand.
 Brenna and Riker ENTER. The first officer has left books spilled across his desk. Brenna surveys the disorder.
 Booting along at warp speed.
 Data has the bridge. Supernumeraries at all other stations. Worf is heading for the forward turbolift as Riker emerges from the forward lift. The first officer looks very content.
 Brenna, also looking very content, is tatting lace (or sewing). Suddenly she notices movement behind some cargo containers.
 A secluded corner behind some cargo containers. Danilo and two other men are working about a still. Worf comes around the containers.
 Coming into orbit around a ringed planet.
 Present are Picard, Riker, Data, Worf and Troi. There is a supernumerary at CONN.
 The away team MATERIALIZES. Granger (1B) dressed in black diplomat clothes is waiting for them. Riker stares because he looks a lot like Granger, but... Nearby an athletic BLACK MAN (2A) is seated behind a curving desk. A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN (3B) emerges from a doorway behind him, and they confer over some papers. Behind the away team an athletic black man (2B) ENTERS. The man behind the desk and the man entering are identical. (Please cast a racial mix for the clone society.)
 Granger 1B leads the team down a hallway. Another door opens, and an athletic black man (2C) steps out, and walks toward the front doors. Worf does a double take, but can't quite get a look at the man.
 Granger stands, and leans over his desk, hand extended, a broad smile of welcome. Riker and Worf are spooked, they're not responding well to this situation.
 In orbit around Mariposa.
 Present are Picard, Riker, Pulaski and Granger. There is a coffee service on the desk, and they are each holding a glass. Pulaski has her tricorder in her lap.
 Riker Pulaski, Geordi and three n.d. crewmembers. Geordi has his tool kit. The three officers, each accompanied by a crewperson move off in opposite directions.
 Riker and Pulaski ENTER. Granger is seated at his desk. A couple of AIDES (5A and 5B) stand beside the door. Two athletic clones flank the desk (2A, 2B and
 Riker and Pulaski are unconscious on surgical tables. Using long hand-held needles, two clones (4A and 4B) in surgical gear penetrate the officers' sternums to remove tissue samples. Two NURSES (5A and 5B) assist. In the b.g. is the cloning equipment open and empty.
 In orbit around Mariposa.
 As many extras as can possibly be squeezed into the hold, all dressed in scruffy immigrant clothes. An occasional cry from a baby, chickens clucking. Accompanied by traditionally Irish instruments, Danilo, the colony's Shan'a'kee, imparts the history. Worf is seated with Brenna, Picard ENTERS, and leans against a wall just listening.
 Riker and Pulaski are seated and talking quietly as Geordi ENTERS.
 Riker, Pulaski and Geordi beam into the chamber. At last we see two of the cloning units. Riker approaches one of the smoke filled artificial wombs. He opens the door, and the smoke vents into the lab. Inside is a half-formed clone, but it is still recognizably the first officer.
 There is a moment of complete dislocation as Geordi and Pulaski look from Riker to the armed clones, and back again. Geordi stares from the first officer with his phaser in hand to the empty space which used to hold the cloning equipment.
 Present are Picard, Riker, Pulaski, and Troi.
 Picard, Pulaski, Danilo, and Granger hunkered down for some hard bargaining.
 Picard, Granger and Danilo step into the Cargo Hold. Danilo crosses quickly to Brenna, and they begin talking.
 Picard in the command chair, Troi is at his side. Worf is at Tactical. Data at OPS. Supernumerary at CONN. Riker and Pulaski ENTER from the aft turbolift.

Each mottled face resembles an oversized catfish: huge gaping mouth, spindly whiskers, big fish eyes, and a skeletal structure that gives them a grotesque, unhealthy appearance. Their hooded, crimson robes only emphasize their eerie, menacing appearance. But what is really bizarre is that they're completely motionless -- catatonic. A medium-sized container arrives with them.
 Wesley steps over to the container and lifts the cover. It's filled with a writhing, squirming mass of worm-like creatures.

 It's as if he slapped her face. Worf turns back to the console, punches up a screen:

 On the screen, the star field SHIMMERS -- and the T'Ong APPEARS as it drops its cloaking. It FIRES phasers at us --
 as the bridge is SHAKEN slightly by the attack.
 as the T'Ong FIRES a photon torpedo --
 as the torpedo hits, SHAKING the ship a bit more.
 motionless, facing the T'Ong.
 as the image of the T'Ong is replaced by a view of the T'ONG BRIDGE. K'TEMOC, the captain, is a formidable warrior who commands his ship with a typical Klingon iron first. A FIRST OFFICER and another KLINGON CREWMAN are in the b.g.
 The captain of the Enterprise is a Klingon! Worf, in full Klingon captain regalia, sits in the command chair glaring at K'Temoc.
 The Klingon crewmen are stunned. So is K'Temoc, but he keeps a lid on it and blusters back to Worf:
 Worf gives K'Temoc a look as if K'Temoc were a two-year-old challenging a parent.
 I have standing orders to fire on all Federation ships. We are at war.
 On the screen, K'Temoc plays his last card:
 As Picard and Riker approach from o.s. The mood is jubilant. Worf stands.
 K'Ehleyr and Worf ENTER.
 Worf turns to face K'Ehleyr. They treat each other in the most formal manner -- perhaps as a way of easing the separation.
 Perhaps to cover his sorrow, his face bears something with a close resemblance to a smile...
 as K'Ehleyr DEMATERIALIZES.
 as his face returns to the more familiar unemotional expression of -- the Iceman.
 Shuttle coming in.
 DATA is at Command, supernumeraries at Conn and OPS, and WORF and ENSIGN BURKE confer at Tactical. All heads turn as the forward turbolift opens and RIKER and KOLRAMI, a slender weasel-like creature, ENTER and cross to the Observation Lounge.
 Mister Kolrami -- Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Welcome aboard.
 Worf crosses to Data.
 A magnificent view of the galaxy surrounds them as they take their seats at one end of the table. Kolrami keys the screen, and the DIAGRAM of a solar system appears.
 Plying deep space at impulse.
 Picard, Riker, Data, PULASKI, and Kolrami are present. Supernumeraries at Conn and Ops. Burke at Tactical.
 Geordi and an ASSISTANT toil at aligning the warp engine's dilithium chamber.
 The room has been modified into a Klingon haven. The lighting is subdued with a ruddy overtones. There is a powerful scupture of a Klingon man, bare to the waist taming a horse-like beast with a long snaking neck, and two twisted horns springing from above each eye.
 Zooming along at impulse.
 Riker ENTERS to find Picard in the Command Chair, Data to his right, Pulaski on his left, Wesley at Conn, Burke at Tactical, and Kolrami examining Science One.
 Geordi and Riker on their way to Ten-Forward.
 Riker and Kolrami are seated at opposite ends of a large table. Worf helps Riker prepare for the game while Troi performs the same function for the Zakdorn.
 Against an opponent of approximate skill -- Strategema can last well over one thousand moves.
 I have wagered heavily in the ship's pool that you will take him past the sixth plateau.
 Forever curious, this urge to "compete."
 presiding over the contest.
 Moving in synchronous orbit with an unlit, eighty year-old starship around a dusty orange planet.
 The dark, lifeless Hathaway dominates the Main Viewer. Picard, Riker, Data, Burke at Tactical, supernumeraries at all other stations, and Kolrami are in attendance. The Zakdorn periodically makes notes on a PADD.
 As Riker, Worf, Geordi, Wesley, and Ensign Nagel (female) ENTER. They take a moment to familiarize themselves with the surroundings as Geordi moves to an old style panel, studies it for a moment, and presses. AUXILIARY LIGHTS snap on, revealing --
 Panels have been ripped out, science stations gutted, etc. This ship does not look like it will fly. Riker steps down to the captain's chair in the DIM LIGHT as the others move to check out various stations.
 A disaster area of proportions as to make the bridge look comfy.
 of the open-mouthed Wesley, and the deeply concerned Geordi, who slowly lowers his tool-carrier to the floor.
 It's a real mess down here, but we'll get to work on it.
 Wesley toils in the empty dilithium crystal chamber, Geordi puts the finishing touches on the patched-together impulse engines. Geordi presses a panel and the impulse engines SPRING TO LIFE, filling the ship with a healthy HUMM and THROB.
 establishing the two in proximity. Suddenly the Hathaway's lights come up.
 Nice work, Geordi, now what's the possibility for warp drive?
 There are only minute dilithium fragments left in the holding clamps. And even if we had intact crystals, there's no anti-matter to fuel the drive.
 Picard and Data are seated. Pulaski ENTERS from the aft turbolift. Burke is at Tactical, supernumeraries at Conn and Ops.
 Switches from an exterior of the Hathaway to Riker on the bridge of the Hathaway. Worf and Nagel are effecting repairs in the background.
 Riker and Worf confer. Nagel works in the b.g.
 The lining is still smooth, and we ought to be able to do something with the dilithium chips we scavenged. Sure the system is functional, but without antimatter what difference does it make?
 Attempt the routing bypass here! If it works, they will be surprised.
 Troi helps Data prepare for Strategema. Opposite, Kolrami is set, waiting. Pulaski smiles with match-maker satisfaction while other CREWMEMBERS look on.
 Picard is in the Command Chair, while Kolrami sits to his left. Burke is at Tactical, supernumeraries at Conn and Ops. Data is conspicuously absent.
 The magnetic chamber is round, about the size of a human head -- a clear orb with a snowball-sized piece of anti-matter suspended in the center. Long, intricately-cabled pieces of clear tubing extend out from opposite sides of the orb -- generating the force which keeps the anti-matter from escaping and wreaking havoc. Attached to the end of the tubes are finger-friendly handles.
 Geordi is hard at work with his back to the gizmo as it MATERIALIZES. It falls onto its side with a CLUNK. Geordi looks over his shoulder and gapes at the gizmo.
 The crew is hard at work, watched over by Picard and Kolrami.
 No sooner has the door closed behind Kolrami when --
 Data is viewing the wall monitor on which incalculable amounts of technical information fly by at incredible rates of speed. There is a CHIME.
 Riker ENTERS to find Geordi and Wesley hard at work installing the orb in the anti-matter chamber.
 Just barely visible -- wedged into the fingers of the clamps -- are MINUTE CHIPS of the valuable mineral.
 We plan to channel the reaction through the chips.
 Data is still viewing the wall monitor. There is a chime.
 Geordi, Wesley and their TEAM are hard at work. Riker ENTERS.
 Picard, seated at his desk, stares in frowning amazement at Troi and Pulaski. Their expressions are serious and intent.
 As before -- Data hard at work. There is a CHIME.
 Troi and Data.
 Picard stands in front of his chair, Data seated at his side, Kolrami hovering nearby. Burke is at Tactical, supernumeraries at Conn, Ops, and other stations.

 The Hathaway (spatially "behind" Enterprise) is firing beam after beam at the bigger ship.
 Picard realizes he's been had! Picard presses a button and Red Alert is cancelled.
 Their delight is infectious, it leaps off the screen.
 Ready photon torpedoes.
 Incredible tension.
 On viewer, a vicious Ferengi warship hurls attack after attack at our perspective. Picard tries to maintain order while the Red Alert continues. The pace quickens, overlaps!
 The image of the looming Ferengi craft is replaced by the visage of TWO ENEMY OFFICERS.

 GEORDI is moving through some underbrush.
 As Geordi rounds a bend and comes upon RIKER who is frowning.
 O'BRIEN inputs the coordinates but when he attempts to beam them up, an ALARM SOUNDS on the console.
 Geordi impatiently touches his communicator.
 O'Brien is working on his control panel.
 As Geordi and Riker listen.
 PULASKI is now present with full medical kit. O'Brien is filling her in, showing her a readout on the console.
 Riker and Geordi as before. Pulaski MATERIALIZES, takes a beat to check that she's still in one piece, takes out her medical tricorder, and steps over to Riker.
 Pulaski rises and touches her communicator.
 Two MEDICAL CREWMEN are standing by. Geordi, Riker, and Pulaski MATERIALIZE. The medical crewmen cross to Riker's side to help him over to a medical table. Riker waves them away.
 The ship is still in orbit.
 Riker is on the center table. Pulaski is off to the side studying her instruments. PICARD ENTERS.
 Pulaski leaves a work station and steps over to the wall panel.
 Displayed on the wall panel is a rendering of Riker's body. Pulaski touches the panel, and the injury to Riker's leg becomes highlighted.
 Pulaski turns back to the examination table. She holds a sophisticated scanner.
 DATA and Geordi are preparing to mount the platform. Each carries a tricorder and a large phaser. O'Brien is behind the console.
 Data and Geordi MATERIALIZE. Because of what happened to Riker this place is ominous.

 Data turns the vine over -- and we can now see a meanlooking thorn protruding from the underside of the vine.
 As they study it.
 as Geordi fires up a pinpoint phaser beam to cut loose the thorn. But the moment the beam touches the vine:
 The area around Geordi and Data begins to move. Large clumps of vines vibrate. It is as if they are standing on a great living thing, which has just awoken, and is very angry.
 O'Brien is behind the console. Picard ENTERS as O'Brien hits the button. Geordi and Data MATERIALIZE on the platform.
 as Geordi looks himself over. No blood anywhere.
 FADE IN:
 Pulaski is at a library console, entering data. Picard is looking over her shoulder. One of the medical crewmen enters, hands Pulaski a chip which she inserts into the console. She's not pleased with what is displayed.
 Riker, lying on the bed as before, flexes his right arm by making a fist and then spreading his fingers wide. His look of concern tells us the numbness is spreading.
 Pulaski is still working away at her console as Picard ENTERS.
 in orbit around the planet.
 One of the medical crewmen is running the scanner over Riker's body. Riker's weak; his arms and legs are so much dead weight, and it's a bit of an effort for him to speak. Still, he's at his most charming:
 as Troi steps forward. Riker sees her, doesn't change expression -- but falls silent. The crewman completes the scan, puts away the scanner, EXITS... leaving Troi and Riker alone in the room.
 A shared moment. Then Riker's devil-may-care manner returns:
 ENTERS quickly and examines Riker.
 as Pulaski punches up the display of Riker's nervous system. The highlighting has expanded and now reaches the spinal column.
 as she picks up a hypospray, gives Riker a shot. Riker doesn't respond, but his vital signs stabilize -- still quite low.
 Orbiting the planet.
 Riker is unconscious. At the head of Riker's bed is a strange device -- a tunnel-shaped apparatus designed to encircle the patient. On one side is a binocular eyepiece somewhat like an electron microscope's. Troi looks on as Pulaski and the two medical crewmen position the device. Over this:
 as the crewmen prepare the device.
 His head has been clamped to the table to keep it perfectly motionless. The device slides slowly into place, surrounding his head.
 as she puts her eyes to the eyepiece and operates the controls of the device.
 as his head is bathed in light. Two thin, needletipped probes extend from the device. The probes break the skin of Riker's temple, keep moving until about three inches of the needle tips have been inserted into Riker's head.
 keeping her eyes to the eyepiece and making fine adjustments to the device.
 as two more probes appears, insert themselves into Riker's forehead.
 nodding with satisfaction.
 as two more probes insert themselves into Riker's head from underneath, entering at a point underneath the ear. Once those probes are in place, two more probes appear and insert -- making a total of eight.
 taking her eyes from the device's eyepiece, checking Riker's vital signs monitor, and turning to one of the medical crewmen:
 on Riker's face as Pulaski activates the current. Riker's face twitches involuntarily as current is applied to the probes -- and then he is motionless. Then a variation of the ripple dissolve...
 Dimly lit, a twilight world of overcast, turbulent skies hanging heavily over a strange landscape of coral-like "trees." LIGHTNING explodes above, as a dull THUNDER echoes through this eerie labyrinth.
 CLOSE on Riker's sweating, tormented face. WIDEN to include Troi and Pulaski. Pulaski punches up the view of Riker's nervous system. The highlighting now includes part of the brain. Pulaski then examines the vital signs monitor:
 The wave patterns are still too irregular.
 his expression less agitated than before...
 The Parkland hidden at this moment by a WILD SECTION OF CORRIDOR WALL AND HATCHWAY which, when the hatch is opened, will REVEAL PARKLAND.
 as Riker ENTERS through it and stands inspecting the Parkland scene with genuine appreciation and then HEARS SOMEONE WHISTLING A MELODY, but doing it rather badly and laboriously.
 as he MOVES AWAY, seeking the source of the WHISTLING which will begin to grow LOUDER now.
 as Riker crosses, stepping from rock to rock. He makes a misstep, almost falls, then recovers and gets across. He looks back at the stone which caused it.
 As he walks, the WHISTLING is nearby now. He stops, calls:
 Riker ENTERS SHOT through shrubbery, sees something and stops.
 Lying there, cushioned by deep grass. He's totally absorbed in certain melody notes he's attempting -- and keeps missing.
 Moving onto TWO SHOT where he stops, and WHISTLES the same melody, hitting the correct notes. A startled Data looks up blankly, then comes quickly to his feet, but Riker waves him back down, sits beside him.
 Riker looks up from a panel.
 Wesley sits with Riker at the bar. Guinan watches them from behind the bar.
 Riker's face is calmer. WIDEN to reveal Pulaski and Troi. Troi is concentrating.
 as we PUSH IN again and
 The kind of place you'd like to visit. No particularly formalized furnishing plan -- it includes just about any way anyone would like to sit or loll. The same sort of revealing but sensible garb here too -- along with good humor. In fact, joy is what is mainly present here. Lots of fruit, nuts, food and drink selections. A MUSIC GROUP of harpists in sight -- admittedly strange looking harps on which they compose, and now and then PLAY LILTING MUSIC which, like everything else, is not taken too seriously here either.
 as they are taken charge of with great hospitality.
 TRUCKING WITH RIKER as he passes through the Council Chamber bemused at the sight of the Edo of all ages and both sexes enjoying music, food, and each other. He comes to three who are playing a game with what appear to be marbles, each holding one to five of them hidden in the hand, then all of them simultaneously revealing how many each of them holds. We don't have to know the rules -- they know them and two of them will LAUGH delightedly at the total of marbles exposed. One will HANG HIS/HER HEAD in mock despair. Then when they look up to find Riker watching, they extend marbles to him, an offer to let him play too.
 as Riker moves into TWO SHOT with him.
 This three-dimensional, computer-generated image is so beautiful it takes Riker's breath.
 As Riker sits down, the IMAGES COME TO LIFE. The combo BEGINS TO PLAY, the woman (Minuet) MOVES.
 He looks at her with interest.
 A slight change occurs in Minuet. The way she looks at Riker is more personal.
 Riker APPROACHES the table. Minuet smiles a greeting.
 As they STEP ONTO the dance floor, Minuet turns and folds herself into his arms. They dance. It's slow and sexy.
 CLOSE on Riker's face. PAN up to Troi's face -- which is a bit flushed. Pulaski notices.
 William, is something wrong?
 Beata touches his chest.
 CLOSE on Riker. WIDEN to reveal Troi composing herself as Pulaski punches up the highlighted view of Riker's body and nervous system. To Pulaski and Troi's dismay, the highlighting is stronger than ever.
 Pulaski moves from the monitor to Troi's side.
 Riker moves a STEP CLOSER to the slime creature.
 Angle on Tasha's body and the others around her. Beverly quickly takes a reading. She can't believe the instruments.
 The medical team is easing Tasha onto the operating table as Picard ENTERS. Beverly barely glances up at him. He MOVES OFF TO THE SIDE and watches silently, with Data and Riker, as:
 The away reserve team MATERIALIZES. They are in a passageway which has been severely damaged by explosions. Water SPRAYS from the ceiling and is already ankle deep on the floor. Data scans the area with his tricorder.
 as they ARRIVE at a doorway. The door has been jammed by the explosion. Data steps over and with his great strength -- rips the door off its hinges and clears the opening.

 CAMERA MOVES IN TO E.C.U. Geordi is staring at a pile of rubble.
 With great strength he moves huge rocks with remarkable rapidity.
 They stand and look for a beat, then:
 as he lifts and carries the limp body of a child.
 Beverly rushes over and while Data holds the child, she quickly examines him.
 From her expression it is clear the child is dead. All of her skill will not help.
 He steps closer. A dead child. A moment of truth.
 He is fighting his emotions.
 Puzzled.
 as Pulaski leads the others to Troi's quarters.
 resets the injector and again she administers a dose of hypospray. She waits for a reaction. There is none.
 The room is very quiet. Pulaski stands.
 Troi reaches out and with cupped hands she collects the LIGHT, cradles it gently and brings it to her. As she holds it close, it makes her face all aglow. Slowly the pain and despair drain away, and through the tears she smiles. The joy she now feels shines from her eyes. The Betazoid within her, embraces the essence of the entity before her and she knows now why he came and what he wanted. Then, in an act of pure love, she releases the glowing energy as she would a dove. For a beat the LIGHT seems reluctant to leave. Then it does. It passes effortlessly through the wall of the ship and away. Troi stares after it for a beat.
 CLOSE on Riker; WIDEN to include Troi and Pulaski, who are encouraged as they observe the panel showing Riker's nervous system. The highlighting has dimmed just a bit.
 A quick, reflexive movement as the pattern of current changes --
 Riker and his escort enter onto the bridge.
 The Klingon crewmembers watch him, waiting to see his reaction to this challenge.
 Riker eyes the arrogant stance and size of Klag who gives him an insubordinate snort. Riker realizes he has no choice. He deftly, with no advance warning or aggressive motion, swings a two-handed blow with his full strength and lands a monstrous blow across the chest of Klag.
 The sound of the blow against Klag's chest armor echoes through the bridge and is followed by the roar of his breath leaving his body, and then his bulk smashing against the bulkhead and slipping to the ground.
 Kargan applauds with a grunt and a motion of his head.
 My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is how to obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner over that of lieutenant?
 Quinn is sitting on the sofa, blankly staring into his slightly opened briefcase. Riker ENTERS, catching him off guard...
 ARMUS HAS MOVED OFF THE SHUTTLE AND as it APPROACHES THE GROUP, Riker suddenly feels a great force pull him. He calls out. Data MOVES to help him.
 CLOSE on the unconscious Riker, under terrific stress to include Pulaski and Troi. On the wall panel, the highlighting showing the organism's presence has remained the same.
 We've reduced the growth rate even further... but not enough.

 CLOSE on Riker, pale and deathly. WIDEN to reveal Troi and Pulaski. Troi looks at the wall panel:
 He looks like a fighter after a series of hard jabs, and the memories now rush at him.
 A BLINDING CACOPHONY of juxtaposed IMAGES -- VOICES -- PIECES OF SCENES. The tempo quickens, builds to a climax, and --
 as his body jerks in a massive convulsion --
 as Riker's vital signs jump -- then slowly begin returning to normal levels. Pulaski, surprised, turns to the wall panel --
 The highlighting is gone.

 Moving at impulse near some extraordinarily interesting astronomical object.
 Present are PICARD, BEVERLY, and TWELVE N.D. CREWMEMBERS. A VULCAN and ONE WOMAN are seated, holding their instruments -- a violin and a viola. O'BRIEN tunes his cello. DATA ENTERS carrying a violin. He checks at the door, startled to see the captain. Picard beckons, and Data crosses to him.
 O.s., the string quartet TUNES. There is the SOUND of the communicator hail.
 Picard ENTERS. RIKER and WORF at their usual stations. Supernumeraries at CONN and OPS.
 What appears is the text of a treaty. English on one side, Sheliak on the other. Sheliak is not symbols as we know them, but rather a pattern of lights. A recorded message begins.

 Picard and Worf in their usual places. Riker at Science One. Supernumeraries at Conn and Ops.
 Haritath and Kentor wait patiently for Data to finish him communication.
 Understood. How many are there?
 The main pumping station of Tau Cygna V. In the distance are mountains. A thin white line descends from the mountains, and as it comes closer we realize it is an aqueduct. Along the line of the aqueduct are lush fields, a veritable Garden of Eden, which ends like a knife-cut and the desert returns. It culminates in a strange cubistic-shaped purifying station. In a pool, the water churns into a white froth.

 as it changes from a view of stars to -- someplace? a bridge? Wherever the SHELIAK are calling from it is a disturbing place for humans. Darkness, mirrored surfaces, and hidden in the shadows a creature who is decidedly unsettling for the crew. Its shape is constantly shifting like oozing sludge, and there is a hint of flickering eyes -- too many eyes.
 A comfortable room constructed of stone with a heavy beamed ceiling. The furniture is hand hewn, durable but comfortable. Contrasting with this are various computer parts and consoles, both assembled and in pieces, strewn about.
 as Data's communicator TRILLS. He touches the insignia.
 Geordi, O'Brien and WESLEY have the panels removed from the wall behind the transporter console. Geordi's tool box is nearby. Sophisticated tools litter the floor. Off to the left side of the transporter are six test objects. The trio is watching tensely as O'Brien touches the console. A test object MATERIALIZES looking like swiss cheese. Geordi picks it up. Riker ENTERS.
 Gosheven, Data, and Ard'rian are standing near the pool of water. Gosheven cups some water in a hand.
 In orbit around Tau Cygna V.
 Picard is pacing rapidly about the office. Riker ENTERS.
 Riker pacing slowly, looking out at the stars.
 Data standing alone in an archway.
 What's the situation?
 Travelling at warp speed.
 As before, except there are more high tech tools and equipment lying about. Geordi is lifting yet another trashed test object off the platform. He holds it mutely out to Wesley and O'Brien who stare dully at this latest failure. There are now four intact objects and three blasted ones. Picard ENTERS.
 A large horseshoe-shaped amphitheater with a place for the engineers and Gosheven. A number of citizens -- including Haritath and Kentor -- have turned out for the debate so the place is filled. In the b.g. is the aqueduct purifying plant.
 The crowd. Data's starting to get a reaction. People are beginning to eye each other nervously. It's one thing to thumb your nose at a distant enemy, quite another to talk about dying.
 As he reaches down, and takes a YOUNG BOY (twelve or so) by the arm, and pulls the child up next to him.
 as he begins to applaud slowly.

 Wesley, Geordi and O'Brien. There are now three intact test object and four trashed ones. These are three exhausted people. They've been working round the clock.
 Data watches the town meeting break up into small groups of people TALKING among themselves. Ard'rian approaches.
 Traveling at warp speed.
 Picard has brought Troi in for consultation.
 The tension on the bridge is palpable. Picard moves swiftly to the command station. Riker relinquishes command.
 Where a Sheliak ship hangs ominously.
 Haritath, Kentor, and a group of other colonists are gathered around Data and Ard'rian.
 Gosheven fills the doorway. He ENTERS and looks around the room.
 She's pulled out an electronic scanner from her piles of computer junk and is checking out the fallen Data.
 to include Gosheven.
 Picard and Troi MATERIALIZE. What surrounds them bears little resemblance to a ship. Darkness hangs like bats in the corners. What little light there is filters through swirling mist. As they look down the effect is as if they are walking on black ice, and tiny lights, like flickering eyes twinkle beneath the floor's surface.
 The startling EFFECT of the Sheliak transporter and Picard and Troi APPEAR. Riker, Worf, and the supernumeraries at Conn and Ops react.
 Ard'rian worriedly inspects the unmoving Data with an electronic scanner. Data twitches, "reboots," comes back to life, and sits up. Ard'rian SIGHS, relieved.
 Data has opened up a phaser and is adapting it. His forearm is opened, revealing his arm's inner workings; Data is "cannibalizing" his arm for parts to modify the phaser. Ard'rian looks on in fascination.
 The Enterprise hanging motionless in space with the Sheliak ship.
 As before.
 No response.
 The square. FOUR MEN armed with rifles stand shoulder to shoulder in front of the plant and aqueduct. Standing defiant and unarmed, save for the probe at his belt, on an upper level is Gosheven.
 A PHASER BEAM sweeps across the line of armed men, STUNNING them instantly. No one even gets a shot off.
 as Data steps out into the street, holds his phaser up for all to see.
 Gosheven, slump shouldered, bends and scoops up a handful of dirt at the base of the silent pool. Data moves to join him.
 watching Gosheven go. Data looks down at the phaser for several moments, then holsters it. He looks up to find Ard'rian gazing at him with an expression of pride and love.
 Troi is seated at Science One with Picard hanging over her shoulder. Riker and Worf are at Science Two. Pages of treaty crawl past on both screens.
 Data is inside the shuttle making preparations for departure.

 Wesley ENTERS with urgency... gets out the materials he was studying earlier. He opens the container that he had discovered when he awakened and checks it with a scanner. There is no response. He sighs deeply. Something horrible has happened.
 The room is deserted due to the captain's order to remain in quarters. Wesley moves around a corner down on his knees... setting down a high tech trap...

 Wes has collected his traps. He's scanning a few with no results... but then there's an audio response from his scanner on one. Before he can make a visual check, the door slides open and his mother ENTERS.

 entering. Beverly exchanges a glance with Guinan, pleased.
 Moving away at warp speed and...
 The Enterprise is entering a star system at impulse speed.
 WORF, DATA and WESLEY are at their stations. PICARD and RIKER have their eyes on the Main Viewer. BEVERLY and TROI are present as advisors. The entire ship is on alert, ready for anything.
 The planet of Rana IV slowly grows into being on the Main Viewer.
 The Main Viewer shows an incredible sight: an extreme aerial SHOT of a six square acre plot of unscathed land; an incongruous patch of green surrounded by a sea of devastation. The crew of the Enterprise is stunned.
 The Enterprise orbits Rana IV.
 Picard with Troi and Beverly walk toward the Transporter Room. He is consulting with them on the two occupants of the structure on Rana IV.
 Data, Worf and GEORDI are in position on the pad. Riker and Beverly join them. Picard and Troi observe.
 The house, a typical twenty-fourth century colonial structure, stands alone on its plot of trees and grass surrounded on all sides by scorched earth. There is no sign of life, inside or out.
 As the away team MATERIALIZES in the protection of a grove of trees near the house's front door. Riker wants an instant survey.
 Riker leaves the cover of the trees and moves toward the house. Suddenly Geordi sees something --
 An elderly man, KEVIN UXBRIDGE, comes cautiously out of the house, holding the phaser.
 As Rishon ignores Kevin and approaches the away team. There are tears of joy in her eyes. Riker slips down out of the tree.
 Riker moves away from the others to study the house up close. Kevin leaves Rishon to follow him.
 As Riker ENTERS. The interior is as normal as a twenty- fourth century colonial interior can be. There are elements of Rishon, elements of Kevin. Nothing to indicate that they are bad people. The rest of the away team follows Riker in. They spread out.
 Rishon and Kevin ENTER the house. Rishon is determined to make her rescuers welcome. She heads for the kitchen with --
 Data has wandered to a small table where an ornate MUSIC BOX sits. He studies the music box. Just then Rishon emerges from the kitchen and moves toward a cupboard where her tea service is stored. She sees Data looking at the music box.
 Data carefully lifts the box. (NOTE: any convenient waltz music will do for the music.) A few bars and we:
 Troi is going about her normal daily routine inside her quarters. Suddenly she comes alert as if hearing something. We realize she is hearing the music from the music box in her head (although she doesn't know this)! And it stays, playing over and over...
 Riker and Beverly are consulting with each other near the front door. Riker is at a lost to explain the riddle of the house and Kevin and Rishon.
 As the music in the music box runs down. Data smiles. Just then, Riker interrupts them.
 The Enterprise keeps orbit around the shattered planet.
 Picard is in the middle of debriefing Riker, Beverly, Geordi and Data. Troi is there as a consultant -- but she seems distant, lost in thought, troubled (because the song is still playing in her mind). All are seated at the table except Picard who paces with controlled energy.
 Picard walks alone, moving toward a turbolift. He is intercepted by Worf.
 Troi is on her bed, fully clothed, trying to sleep. She looks strained, tired. From her actions we know the song is still playing in her head. She tosses and turns. Sleep is impossible. She sits on the bed and rubs her face. She stands and paces. She puts her hands over her ears as if the song could be stopped that way. Nothing works. She talks to herself.
 Picard ENTERS the room. He sees Troi's condition and knows something must be wrong.
 Riker is manning the bridge along with Data, Worf, Wesley and various SUPERNUMERARIES.
 We see the gleaming hull of an immense and deadly-looking spaceship approaching Rana IV. We don't need to be told it's the ship that attacked the planet only weeks ago.
 Picard ENTERS the bridge and takes one look at the approaching warship.
 On the Main Viewer, the warship is seen making a course change to bring it to bear on the Enterprise.
 The Enterprise fires across the warship's nose. It responds by moving into a higher orbit and heading quickly away from the Enterprise and Rana IV.
 The bridge crew is pleased to see the enemy turning tail and running.
 The Enterprise follows the warship away from Rana IV, their velocities increasing.
 All eyes are on the Main Viewer and the unknown warship.
 The pursuit continues at a faster and faster pace... still the Enterprise does not seem to be gaining.
 It's obvious to everyone that the Enterprise isn't gaining.
 FADE IN:
 The Enterprise is once again in orbit around Rana IV.
 Picard, Worf and a MATTER REPLICATOR MATERIALIZE in front of the Uxbridge house. Rishon and Kevin are both doing yard work. Both are naturally surprised at Picard's appearance. Kevin looks genuinely upset. Picard takes the initiative --
 Troi is nearly hysterical. Two of Beverly's MEDICAL ASSISTANTS try to help.
 Picard and Worf are having tea with the Uxbridges. Kevin is silent, moody, wishing they were gone. Rishon is radiant, full of energy and love of life. Worf looks uncomfortable, out of place.
 (NOTE: Troi's quarters have been adapted for medical treatment.) Troi is on her bed, sleeping; but it is not a peaceful sleep. From the way her lips move and from her tortured expression we know the song is still playing in her mind.
 Riker is on the bridge along with Wesley, Data and various supernumeraries.
 The unknown warship appears in all its horrible glory.
 As the warship lets fly with an awesome barrage of electro-magnetic and particle death. The Enterprise rocks. The bridge lights flicker. It's a heavy hit --
 The Enterprise lets fly. The warship is hit -- but it might as well have been with a feather pillow.
 The vessel appears undamaged. Its defenses are apparently able to absorb incoming matter and energy.
 The Enterprise limps for deep space as fast as it is able. The warship hangs back, now in complete possession of Rana IV.
 Worf is bitter -- but understanding -- about fleeing the battle.
 The Enterprise moves away from the Rana system at impulse speed.
 Picard and Beverly move quickly for Troi's quarters.
 Picard and Beverly ENTER. Move to where Troi is sleeping. She is still in induced coma, but showing subtle signs that indicate the music is still in her head. Picard is concerned.
 A couple of hours have passed. The ship cautiously limps back into orbit around Rana IV.
 Riker, Worf, Wesley and Data are at their stations with various supernumeraries. Picard is pacing in front of his chair.
 The house looks as it always has.
 Kevin and Rishon are waltzing to music from the music box. They seem very happy; not a care in the world. They are lost in each others gaze. Suddenly the front door opens and Picard, followed by Worf, walks in unannounced. The couple stop dancing. The music box runs down and dies...
 A time lapse. The Enterprise orbits without interference.
 Riker and Data are there as well as the supernumeraries. Picard and Worf ENTER. Picard takes his chair. He is calm; a man of infinite patience.
 The warship is approaching rapidly. Picard seems unbothered. He watches it come.
 Astonishingly, the warship cruises right past the Enterprise and continues on toward Rana IV.
 The bridge crew, Picard excluded, are astonished.
 The Enterprise fires the torpedo at the warship. It strikes home. The warship goes up in a spectacular explosion!
 The bridge crew looks to Picard to explain all this. But he doesn't.
 The Enterprise continues its high orbit over Rana IV.
 Picard sits at his desk, lost in thought. His doorbell chimes.
 Data is in charge. Geordi has joined the bridge crew. The supernumeraries are at their stations. The shattered face of Rana IV rolls by on the Main Viewer.
 As they EXIT the Ready Room in a hurry. Geordi is excited --
 As Rishon and Kevin MATERIALIZE on the bridge. The couple is surprised to say the least -- and worried. Picard addresses them with strained politeness.
 Suddenly the bridge is filled with a brilliant, burning LIGHT coming from no particular source. The light grows to such intensity that all those present must turn away and cover their eyes. There is confusion, shouting. And then the light is gone as suddenly as it came... and so is Kevin.
 Indicating a passage of time.
 Beverly ENTERS from the corridor. She stops dead at the sight of --
 What happened on Rana Four, Kevin? The truth this time -- all of it.
 Kevin and Picard exchange a long look. Kevin nods to Picard. The room suddenly fills with the blinding LIGHT (similar to what happened on the bridge). When it is gone, so is Kevin.
 Our bridge regulars are present including Geordi, Troi (looking well) and Beverly. They all want a last look at the planet. Its scarred and ruined face is on the Main Viewer.
 Cruising at warp speed.
 PICARD is flanked by RIKER and TROI. WORF and DATA are at their stations; SUPERNUMERARIES as needed.
 A hillside with sheer rock walls and outcroppings. About three meters up a nearly sheer rockface is a narrow path. A large section of the rockface above the path SHIMMERS and FADES AWAY -- revealing the exterior ported wall of the "duck blind" (the interior of which is built inside the rockface). BLUE SPARKS dance about the metal structure of the duck blind.
 Palmer stumbles to a port, falls through it to the outside --
 Palmer has fallen clear of the duck blind. Dazed and disoriented, he makes his way down the path and EXITS the area.
 Picard watches the Main Viewer helplessly as the image from Mintaka -- with Barron lying on the floor -- BREAKS UP completely and DISAPPEARS.
 streaking to the rescue.
 in orbit around Mintaka Three.
 Riker, Data, Geordi, BEVERLY, and A MEDIC MATERIALIZE inside the duck blind. SPARKS and CORONA EFFECTS are coursing through all metal parts of the structure.
 Two Mintakans -- middle-aged LIKO and his teenaged daughter OJI -- are walking. Mintakans look very similar to Vulcans -- they have the same pointed ears and arched eyebrows. Note: Though Mintakans are a cool-headed, rational people, they are not as stoic and emotionless as Vulcans.
 Liko and Oji ENTER the area, which is presently unoccupied. Outside the "assembly hall" is a large bronze sundial/astrolabe. Oji steps up to the astrolabe, takes a preliminary sighting. In doing so, she notices something o.s.:
 On a distant hillside, the exterior of the duck blind is visible. Oji points it out to Liko:
 The medic works on Warren as Beverly tends to Barron, who is semi-conscious.
 still working on the reactor; Data is finishing up on the console nearby.
 The medic working on Warren nods to Beverly -- ready. Beverly taps her communicator:
 Peeking in one of the ports is Liko -- stunned at the sight of these strangers magically disappearing. Curious, Liko pokes his head further into the port, and places a hand on the metal frame.
 Liko has fallen away from the duck blind. He slips off the narrow path, falls three meters, and lands hard on a section of jagged rock, severely gashing his head. He GROANS.
 Oji is at the bottom of the path. She's about to come to her father's aid, but holds back as she sees:
 Beverly has already emerged from the duck blind and is heading down the path to Liko's side.
 in intense pain. Beverly approaches, administers a hypo. A moment later, Liko is out cold. Beverly examines him, then touches her communicator:
 emerging from her hiding place and moving toward the spot where her father disappeared.
 Riker and Geordi at the reactor. Geordi finishes up:
 As the camouflage unit kicks in, the duck blind DISAPPEARS; the rockface is now, to all appearances, solid rock.
 gazing bewildered at the wall of rock. She's overwhelmed by the inexplicable wonders she has witnessed.
 Busy. MEDICAL PERSONNEL are performing surgery on Liko and applying various forms of burn and anti-radiation treatment to Warren and Barron.
 as Picard ENTERS, crosses to Liko's biobed, and reacts to the sight of a Mintakan aboard the Enterprise. Picard glowers at Beverly, but before he can speak:
 Barron has regained consciousness, but he's half-delirious and agitated. He struggles wildly with a medic who's trying to restrain him:
 CLOSE on Liko's face -- after a beat, Liko's eyes open.
 Medical personnel, Beverly, and Picard are gathered around Barron's biobed. Picard is the only one in a red uniform; he stands out dramatically.
 as Picard turns, finds himself looking at Liko -- who's looking right back at him. Picard's speechless. After a beat:
 in orbit around Mintaka Three.
 Oji is atop a bluff, finishing her reconnaissance. No luck. She returns to the duck blind rockface, touches it once more. Nothing happens. The hologram generator's doing its job; the rockface looks and feels authentic.
 In a location not visible from the duck blind area, the sleeping body of Liko MATERIALIZES. Slowly, Liko awakens.
 as Oji starts to walk back down the path.
 as Liko sits up, examines himself.
 Picard, Riker, Troi, Data, and Beverly. Beverly is in mid-report.
 Orbiting Mintaka Three.
 The same spot where Liko was beamed down. Riker and Troi MATERIALIZE, along with two bundles of woven cloth.
 A few MINTAKANS are entering the area. Riker and Troi ENTER and follow the Mintakans toward the assembly hall.
 Assorted MINTAKANS are gathered around Liko and Oji. This is the "town hall" where Mintakans meet daily -- both to barter and to talk, philosophize, exchange information, and debate ideas.

 as Liko turns to a skeptical Fento.
 as Nuria steps forward.
 as Riker and Troi step forward and address Liko.
 as HALI and one more MINTAKAN HUNTER (both with elaborately-designed crossbows) come into view at the entrance to the assembly hall -- carrying a bedraggled and unconscious Palmer.
 exchanging a look. So much for their cogent arguments.
 Picard and Beverly in f.g. Warren lies motionless on her biobed, her vital signs dangerously low.
 We have a problem.
 As before.
 Riker and Troi, still out of earshot of the Mintakans, survey the area.
 scowling at Picard.
 Nuria, Liko, Oji, Hali, Fento, and the other Mintakans are still gazing at the unconscious Palmer. Riker stands nearby; Troi is not present. Hali explains:
 Troi ENTERS.
 Troi leads Nuria, Liko, Oji, Hali, and the others off toward the hills.
 Fento leans over Palmer, starts tying him up with a length of woven rope. Riker steps up next to Fento.
 Nuria, Liko, Oji, Hali, and the others are following Troi. Oji suddenly notices the sun's position, stops:
 Fento has been bound and gagged by Riker.
 Riker EMERGES from the assembly hall, carrying Palmer, and heads for a path out of the area (not the same path Troi took).
 Troi leading the others as before.
 Riker is about to reach a path through the rocks surrounding the assembly hall area. Nuria and the others ENTER the area at the other end. Hali levels his crossbow to take a shot at Riker, but Riker ducks between the rocks, EXITS the area. The Mintakans pursue.
 Riker carrying Palmer; Nuria and the Mintakans in pursuit. Finally, Riker finds what he's been looking for: a spot where he's momentarily out of sight of the Mintakans.
 as Riker and Palmer MATERIALIZE in Sickbay. Beverly and a medic help Riker put Palmer on a biobed. Riker stretches his aching muscles.
 Hali uses a knife to cut Fento's ropes. Nuria, Liko, Oji, and other Mintakans surround Troi. Liko's concerned; Troi is calm.
 Picard, Data, and Worf are silent, listening to Troi's communicator. Riker ENTERS.
 You've angered the Picard -- and we may all suffer for it! Weren't there stories of the Overseer destroying those who offended him?
 weighing Liko's argument as the anxious Mintakans look to her for orders. Sometimes being the leader is a hell of a burden.
 Picard, Riker, and Barron.
 Troi is being guarded by two Mintakans. Liko and Oji are standing nearby. Nuria is walking away, toward the exit.
 Troi doesn't react as Data's voice pops into her ear:
 Picard, Riker, Worf, supernumeraries. Data reacts to the odd sound Troi just made.
 Is Nuria the closest of the five?
 In close orbit to Mintaka Three.
 Picard ENTERS, approaches the ENSIGN at the console.
 as Nuria MATERIALIZES -- and GASPS in shock. What's happened? Where the hell is she?
 Picard steps forward, nods reassuringly.
 astonished. She sinks to her knees in fear and reverence, and we --
 Nuria is still on her knees on the transporter pad. Picard takes another step. She averts her eyes.
 Picard and Nuria are at a window, looking at the magnificent sight of Mintaka Three set amid thousands of stars. Nuria is overwhelmed. So many wonders...
 A fire has been lit in a fire pit. Flashes of LIGHTNING outside are followed by distant THUNDER. Liko, Oji, and Fento are worried.
 Nuria and Picard are looking at the model of the Stargazer.
 A sobering realization.
 Oji and Fento ENTER, rush up to a desperate Liko as LIGHTNING CRACKLES outside.
 watching impassively as Liko strides purposefully toward her, crossbow in hand...
 Warren has started to spasm. A medic is at Warren's side. Barron looks on helplessly. Beverly ENTERS, tapping her communicator as she crosses --
 Another spasm. Her eyes open. She tries to speak, but hasn't the strength. Beverly motions for Barron to stand near so Warren can see him. Warren can barely focus -- but she recognizes Barron, tries to take his hand. Barron clasps her tiny, frail hand and holds on.
 Picard lowers his head, grieves over their loss. Nuria, profoundly moved, looks from Picard to Barron to Beverly -- their remorse is palpable.
 As before. The THUNDER continues. Liko steps up to the captive Troi, followed by Oji, Fento, and Hali.
 Liko, agonized, picks up the crossbow and moves toward Troi.
 ENTERING, accompanied by Nuria. Note: This is no grand entrance of a god. Quite the opposite -- they simply walk in the entrance.
 Liko sighs with relief.
 as he blocks Nuria with his arm.
 A jumble of emotions -- anger, frustration, fear, and doubt swirl in Liko's mind.
 as the bolt strikes him in the shoulder -- hurling him to the ground.
 as Nuria rushes to Picard's side. Picard writhes in pain. Nuria touches his wound and holds up her bloody hand for all to see.
 The Mintakans approach Picard with curiosity. The fear and reverence are gone.
 Picard, wearing a sling on his arm, stands before the rockface. (His wounded shoulder has been healed in Sickbay.)
 as she breaks orbit and leaves Mintaka Three behind.
 The ship is in standard orbit over an old and scarred planet. The world is predominantly gray with overtones of flecked green and brown and conveys an impression of an old battlefield coming back to life.
 PICARD and RIKER are standing near an access station observing the play of information across one of the monitors. WESLEY is at the Conn, DATA is at Ops and TROI is in the command area, while SEVERAL N.D. CREWMEMBERS are at duty stations or passing through the Bridge.
 DOCTOR CRUSHER and a MEDICAL ENSIGN move to the Away Team as four people MATERIALIZE.
 While Troi is already sure of the result, the rest of the Bridge crew waits for word from Sickbay.
 in orbit.
 Picard is standing in the doorway. Beverly stands over the bed holding Marla Aster's body. Worf stands nearby. His uniform bears the evidence of the recent violent encounter, blood still seeps from his wound.
 Picard to Bridge.
 Riker at Command. Wesley at Conn, Data at Ops, Supernumerary at tactical.
 The room is very dark. Worf is dressed in an elaborate Klingon robe and sash. A strange, twisted, massive candle burns on the desk before him.
 Troi and Picard. She senses his frustration.
 Picard and Troi ENTER. The classroom is warm, inviting and is crammed with plants, computers, antique books, and myriad games from across the Federation. TWO TEACHERS are working with SEVERAL STUDENTS in two study groups.
 Troi has her hands on Jeremy's shoulders to offer the support of physical contact.
 The Enterprise in orbit around the planet.
 Troi and Jeremy. Troi is seated, watching Jeremy with that cool serenity which is so much a part of her nature. He doesn't quite know what to do with himself. But throughout the scene there is a repressed anger in the boy. (NOTE: This is a significant change... Even though the dialogue may be similar, the attitude behind must reflect unfocused anger that he is unwilling to touch.)
 Riker is seated at a table. He stares out at the stars. There is a drink in front of him.
 Geordi giving his report to Picard and Riker. He has brought back another explosive device... Data studies it.
 Troi is walking, head down, very thoughtful. Worf is coming from the other direction. He sees her, checks, and almost heads down another branching corridor. But Troi senses him and looks up.
 The room is dimly lit and only Worf and Troi are here at present.
 Jeremy is curled up on the sofa looking at a hand held screen with a home video of him and his mother together at home on Earth... his face is thoughtful, reflective, not in pain. There is a CHIME. He goes to the door, touches the panel and it opens to reveal Worf.
 The Captain is going over status reports on the computer screen as the DOORBELL RINGS.
 As Picard and Troi ENTER...
 Wesley ENTERS. Beverly is at her desk, working.
 Me? What for?
 Sometimes I can't quite remember his face... it scares me.
 As before. On the viewscreen is a graphic analysis of the energy form they're tracking on the planet...
 Jeremy is seated at the desk once again studying the moving picture of him and his mother. He senses movement from a hallway behind him, turns to see the arrival of MARLA ASTER. Jeremy's eyes go wide.
 The starship is still cruising serenely in orbit.
 As before. Riker and Picard have moved to join Geordi at the Engineering station, studying the odd readings...
 Jeremy stares with bewilderment up at his mother. Marla Aster reaches out to brush a hand across Jeremy's hair. Jeremy reflexively backs away.
 As before.
 Marla looks calmly at Worf.
 Worf follows Marla and Jeremy down the corridor. Security men arriving do not interfere, exchange glances with Worf, trail...
 Picard and Troi moving quickly...
 O'Brien is making adjustments to the transporter side panels. He is running a monitor over the circuits and comparing readings. The DOOR OPENS and Marla, Jeremy, and Worf ENTER.
 FADE IN:
 Troi and Jeremy walking together. The boy is angry, frightened and sad, completely disoriented.
 And Troi takes an involuntary step back for it is no longer the Enterprise stateroom. They are standing in the front room of the Aster home on Earth... as we saw it in the video...
 Is the boy in any danger?
 Troi off to the side... in the background, the mother doll and Jeremy are dangling a piece of string for the cat... playing with it...
 Mister Data, can we determine for certain the energy source from the planet is powering this creation?
 The fantasy is up and running. Marla and Jeremy are still seated with the cat... Troi moves to them...
 As before.
 The ghost-like blanket has gathered into a glowing circular mass.
 The energy form flashes across space and instantly penetrates the ship.
 The ship is rocked by the explosive arrival of the energy. Red alert begins to sound.
 The energy mass move down the hallway and into
 Security to Transporter Room Three...
 O'Brien is being driven out of the room by the force. Two security guards arrive. They are flung back. One of them fires his phaser, but it has no effect. The energy force zips back into the Transporter Room.
 Troi is comforting Jeremy when Marla and the Earth Home MATERIALIZE, and judging from ??e expression with which she favors Troi she is not happy.
 Captain, the image is back -- she's trying to take Jeremy off the ship again.
 Data working the console...
 The energy force is still there reacting as the power goes off, -- darting from component to component -- as Worf arrives, it bolts past him...
 La Forge, the intruder may try to reinstate Transporter power.
 Just outside Aster's quarters, Marla leads Jeremy out as Troi watches by the door. A force field is blocking the corridor. She turns to look in the another direction. Another force field at the other end of the hall is up and has them trapped.

 Geordi follows the energy form as it moves from console to console...
 The power returns...
 Geordi moves quickly to the controls...
 Picard, Troi, Jeremy and Marla.
 Worf in full Klingon regalia. Jeremy is dressed in a child's version of the Klingon robe. Jeremy and Worf are framed by the window of the stateroom. The room is dark. Five of the intricate candles are on various tables in the B.G. One is lit.

 comes to rest on her shoulder... and now's the moment... and the instant he touches her...
 What?
 WESLEY and DATA standing at the window looking out the windows at a field of immense flotsam and jetsam moving by, the remains of a planet destroyed in a battle long ago...
 PICARD, RIKER, WORF are already at their stations as Data ENTERS. Riker fills them in...
 as the Enterprise alters course. The space debris speeds by -- some fragments dangerously close.
 Approaching the source, Captain...
 An ancient warship lying dead in space.
 A Promellian battle cruiser.
 Captain's log, Stardate 43799.1. We have arrived at Orelious Nine, to chart the battle in which the Menthars and Promellians fought to their mutual extinction. Among the ruins we have found a relic: a Promellian battle cruiser that has withstood the centuries.
 Picard and Riker walking toward the Transporter Room; Picard enthused with a spring in his step, Riker concerned...
 As they arrive... Worf is already waiting along with Data.
 Picard, Worf and Data move around a corner. It is eerily still and dark... Worf lights a powerful flashlamp.
 His head cocked to the side, rather like the skeleton, Geordi downs another glass of synthehol. And he can't quite get drunk, no matter how hard he tries...
 Data is patching in a small power pack... takes a few calculations, then turns it on... dim emergency lighting comes on. They continue their exploration... the sound of the electronic distress signal is coming closer as they work their way down a corridor... Worf is recording images with a tricorder.
 They ENTER. It is a room with several visual monitors as well as radio and electronic equipment. The signal beeps from a console where another skeleton has died... Worf scans the room...
 Riker at command. Wes reacts to something on his console... tries to make adjustments...
 Data has patched in the power. A monitor lights up... and the wire coil begins to turn... the picture is poor and the sound is distorted... but the image of a Promellian commander fades in... he begins to speak....
 As the away team ENTERS from the turbolift... Picard is still enthused... Riker, Wesley and TROI are on the bridge...
 Geordi with Guinan...
 As before.
 As Geordi arrives, taking stock of the situation... on the move -- a sweeping track shot... here's a man in charge, vast talent on display... moving from console to console, monitoring the instruments, making adjustments.
 Power loss now at twelve percent.
 The two vessels lie motionless in close proximity to one another.
 Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, BEVERLY and Geordi.
 As Data MATERIALIZES on the bridge... takes a reading with the tricorder. To his communicator --
 Circuits being tested one after another... a red line signifies working condition...
 watches... enters another command...
 working a keyboard...
 Another test is completed successfully. Geordi frowns...
 Typing: "Access data bank. Enterprise. Galaxy class. Subspace field."
 The name -- "L. Brahms... L. Brahms... L. Brahms... " at the end of each line...
 Picard, Beverly, Wesley, Worf. Somber mood.
 Close on a filed collection of tightly coiled wire.
 Geordi pacing, talking, thinking...
 Geordi arrives, presses a panel outside Holodeck Three.
 A recreation of drafting room five. Banks of computers working, propulsion equipment in various modes of completion. (Through a window can be seen other forms of starship equipment). In the center of the room is the schematic display of the engines. Geordi moves to the display, circles it, greatly impressed by the room, its contents and purposes. To him, it's beautiful.
 As before.
 Geordi still reacting to the image of Leah. (And he's seen her face before on her ID card.)
 The array of equipment, operated full bore by SUPERNUMERARIES, glow in front of Picard and Riker. The coils retrieved from the alien ship are being analyzed and decoded... an operator opens a panel and inserts a coil.
 Sorry, Commander... we haven't addressed that one yet. First priority was to maintain shields.
 Picard out.
 Adjustments to dilithium crystal chamber complete.
 On screen is the fuzzy, distorted image of the Promellian captain, GALEK SAR. There is no audio at first, just hiss and static and isolated words... when it clears up --
 Picard, Riker standing behind Data who is seated.
 Geordi with Leah... in an argument. Voice on top of voice... they're working on the cross-section of the crystal chamber...
 Picard, Riker, Worf, Data and Geordi.
 A multiple stream of phaser fire fans out in one direction.
 Phaser fire strikes the debris. The debris absorbs the fire.
 Slow push in on Picard's face as he realizes the gamble has failed.
 Geordi and Leah huddle over a computer graphic.
 In space. The Promellian cruiser lying dead near it.
 Picard, Riker, Data, Worf and Beverly. Faces are grim.
 Geordi checking over readouts.
 Geordi arrives at the Holodeck...
 Geordi ENTERS. He and Leah share a look of concern.
 Time transition.
 Showing connections between the master computer and other controls... changing rapidly...
 Picard is sitting, staring into the middle distance. There is a chime. He pauses before --
 Geordi and Leah watching a viewer...
 seems like a super sophisticated graphic arcade game... a ship moving through the asteroid field... when it gets too close to one, there is a brilliant beam of energy that covers the ship... the image freezes...
 As before.
 All hands in place except Geordi.
 Geordi, there's no other way...
 Full cast.
 Picard sits down at Conn, looks over the controls.
 as the impulse engines flare to life and almost immediately shut down. The ship slowly starts to move.
 Crew reacting to the force of breaking free. Picard touches the helm panel.
 as Picard stares intently at the asteroid fragments and other debris ahead, decides on the course he wishes to take, and touches his panel.

 Coming to heading three-four-zero mark one-zero.
 gradually adjusting course and gliding silently past the asteroid.
 No reaction from the assimilator.
 as a monstrous asteroid glides into view, dead ahead.
 Wesley's eyes widen. He looks to Riker.
 Picard watches the viewscreen -- but makes no move to fire a thruster.
 heading straight for the massive asteroid and picking up speed.
 Everyone's watching the viewscreen. Geordi and Worf exchange a look -- "I hope he knows what he's doing."
 as the bulk of the asteroid fills the screen. Picard poises a hand over the helm, waits a beat, then fires a thruster --
 as a thruster BLASTS to life. The ship, still gaining speed, slowly changes course -- and instead of colliding with the asteroid, it whips around it -- the slingshot effect flinging the Enterprise on a new course, completely out of the debris field.
 Picard, as impassive as before, shuts down the thruster.
 FIRING a spread of torpedoes that explodes at the ancient vessel... and the entire area goes white with the explosive force obliterating the entire asteroid field.
 Geordi with Leah. A quiet moment.
 As it moves off to explore other worlds...
 A hellish environment bathed in a BLUE-HUED light. Cold and dusty (it is always night), the planet is whipped by gale force winds. Visibility is only a few feet. Crackling blue ARCS of electricity slash across the sky. RIKER, WORF and GEORDI MATERIALIZE. It is an immediate struggle to see. Riker lays a marker down on the ground where they beamed in.
 picking up objects that have a different molecular reading than the ground cover...
 Geordi takes the point...
 as the distance between them increases, there is no longer visual contact... Geordi disappears into the storm as Worf comes across a seriously hurt Romulan (PATAHK).
 moving along the terrain... suddenly without warning, the earth beneath him collapses and...
 Geordi falls hard to the ground, splashing in muddy water... his VISOR is flung from his face on impact... he groans, stunned... reaches out, trying to find the VISOR in the puddle, finally touches it... puts it on... wipes it off... sees that he's in a deep pit...
 COMMANDER RIKER... WORF... HEY UP THERE...
 can't hear him. They are supporting the Romulan... moving him back to the beam-out spot.
 trying his communicator, knowing it doesn't work...
 moving through the storm... it's getting worse...
 Worf kneeling on one leg... the Romulan is barely clinging to consciousness.
 Geordi looks up and no longer bothers yelling. He knows it's useless. As we push into his face...
 In orbit around Galorndon Core, an electromagnetically shrouded planet, obscured by fierce storms and wildly erratic arcs of jagged electricity.
 Much activity... the Romulan being examined by BEVERLY... MEDICAL SUPERNUMERARIES arriving with a gurney...
 Walking...
 We could barely see two meters in front of us down there...
 Emphasizing his point... the storm is continuing to build.
 Geordi is closely examining the muddy walls around him...
 His scan reveals a substance buried in the wall that has a different quality to it than the surrounding soil...
 Geordi reacts, burrows the mud away to reveal --
 Geordi examines it... begins to pull more dirt off the wall, giving himself something of a work-table... using the mud to shape a rough mold... he takes small bits of ore out of the vein, puts them into his mold, uses his phaser to melt them... steam erupts as it turns into hot liquid in the cold mud... and as it collects in the mold, we can see he is creating a short, sharp pole...
 Beverly is with Picard and Riker... as they observe life-saving measures being taken with the Romulan.
 to see he is halfway up the side of the pit... using two of his "spike" tools in each hand to poke into the earth, pulling himself up, inch by inch... the howling of the wind above... crashing thunder... flickering of lightning...
 are almost useless, slipping on the sides...
 as he grits his teeth and raises himself another notch and...
 Geordi's arm reaches over and drives a stake in the ground... pulls himself up and out, exhausted...
 Picard, Riker, Worf, Beverly, TROI, WESLEY and DATA. Picking up in mid-conversation...
 as the image of TOMALAK, a Romulan commander, appears.
 As before.
 turning to Troi.
 Geordi pushes into a crevice offering slim protection from the furious storm... rests out of breath... He is cold and hungry... rubbing his hands together for heat... sees some (basketball-sized) rocks on the ground... leans down to pick one up... and misses it off to the left. He reacts...
 Medical supernumeraries are taking DNA (TECH) samples from several crew members who have reported for testing... moving to find Beverly examining the Romulan's life signs and is not encouraged... to a medical supernumerary --
 Picard, Riker, Worf, Data and supernumeraries...
 FIRING the probe. (STOCK photon torpedo)
 As before. Wesley has returned to Conn.
 Geordi is sitting by the hot rocks when he senses something in the distance... something we can't see...
 To our naked eye, there's nothing there. But...
 reacts to something he sees, stands...
 His VISOR reveals the staccato beacon of light from the neutrino beam... quite a distance away.
 Hope fills his face...
 Geordi moving through the storm along the rocky hillside toward the neutrino beam... as he moves forward...
 to find two feet moving out from cover... coming up quickly behind him and a HARD THUD sound... and Geordi falls into frame unconscious by the feet... and tilt up to see another Romulan (BOCHRA) looking down at him.
 The wind is getting stronger. Geordi, dazed, gets to his knees, shakes his head to clear it. As sense returns, he instinctively reaches for his phaser. It's gone -- as are his tricorder and communicator. Geordi looks up:
 BOCHRA is standing a few meters away, holding Geordi's tricorder and insignia in one hand -- and training a phaser on him with the other. The wind grows more furious. The Romulan does not look entirely well.
 as Geordi and Bochra ENTER. Bochra raises a hand -- is once again levelling a phaser at him.
 Beverly is at her desk as Worf ENTERS, having been summoned...
 Beverly sits with Picard trying to enlist his aid.
 Bochra and Geordi sit facing one another. Bochra's posture is ramrod-straight as he keeps his phaser levelled at Geordi. But he seems oddly overheated for the cold environment. Geordi, however, has made himself as comfortable as possible, reclining and putting his feet up -- a small show of rebellion.
 He sees the neutrino beam through the storm... but suddenly the vision goes haywire.
 reacts...
 Picard, Riker, Troi, Worf, Wesley, Data. Wesley is monitoring the neutrino probe... a concerned look on his face. Riker, impatient for a sign, glances over Wes' shoulder, sighs... a shiver in the signal makes him react... he looks at Wesley who shakes his head...
 Tomalak speaks from his command chair.
 The SOUND of the storm outside has abated. Bochra's definitely not a well Romulan; he's sweating, and his hands have developed a slight tremble. He is clearly much further along in his deterioration than Geordi. But he never takes his eyes -- or the phaser -- off Geordi.
 as Geordi stumbles over a rock, gropes for the walls of the cave.
 Worf approaches a cabin door, considers a beat, then rings the bell.
 Riker is in his quarters studying territorial maps on his computer screen. Worf ENTERS, stops...
 CLOSE on Patahk in the biobed, MUTTERING in semiconsciousness.
 as Worf ENTERS and stays at the door. Beverly crosses to him. Worf looks suspiciously over at Patahk, then at Beverly. Calmly, softly --
 Patahk's eyes open slightly and sees Worf. Hatred succeeds in awakening him even more.
 A dejected Geordi examines his VISOR with his touch. Bochra is lying back now, weaker... The diagnostic BEEP is emitted, signalling all is okay with the VISOR itself.
 Picard, Riker, Data, Worf.
 FADE IN:
 CLOSE ON Bochra's hand shaking badly as he tries to make some final delicate adjustments on the tricorder/VISOR.

 Picard seated. Worf ENTERS.
 The hellish winds have died down and electrical ARCS are few and far between. Vision is still difficult.
 as they come to the probe... barely sticking out of a crater (virtually impossible to see with the naked eye).
 Picard ENTERS; Riker, Troi, Worf, Data, and Wesley at their stations. RED ALERT continues.
 A Romulan warbird majestically cruises into view.
 as Picard stares at the screen.
 Tomalak glares at Picard. Icy formality.
 Wesley reacts to something on his panel.
 as he rises, faces the viewscreen.
 as everyone -- even Picard -- half expects a phaser blast at any moment.
 Sure enough, the view of the warbird is replaced with the image of Tomalak. Bochra immediately salutes his Commander. Still looks pretty bad, though he will improve during the scene...
 as Picard returns to his chair.
 O'Brien is behind the console. Beverly supervises two CREWMEMBERS who are placing a coffin on the transporter pad. Worf, Geordi, and Bochra ENTER. Bochra sees the pallet, looks at Beverly. And she says this to Bochra, but all the while gives Worf a scathing look:
 crossing to the transporter pad -- and his fallen comrade.
 Geordi signals O'Brien, who energizes; Bochra and the pallet DEMATERIALIZE.
 That's the way to fight all the wars from now on. Two guys on a planet with no one else to talk to and nowhere to go. Things get settled in a hurry.
 Sitting.
 She's placid as usual, listening, or perhaps on automatic pilot.
 Troi walking, looking very tired... Wes sees her, calls... moves down another corridor to her...
 who listens patiently as Wesley continues...
 Troi ENTERS, exhausted, starts to take off her jacket...
 A casual party in progress... PICARD, WORF, RIKER, DATA.
 Of course, Captain. I'm on my way. Troi out.
 GEORDI and BEVERLY have joined the fun now too... waiters serve hors d'ouevres... Troi ENTERS, smiling, serene, our Troi... Riker goes to meet her... offers an arm...
 in orbit around the Barzan planet.
 Picard, Worf, Bhavani, Mendoza, Leyor, Devinoni. Bhavani is at the head of the table, addressing the others...

 She is studying personnel files of O'Brien and his girlfriend... but her mind drifts for a moment and she smiles to herself...

 Picard, Riker, Data and Mendoza are studying the viewscreen where charts and graphs of the wormhole are displayed.
 Goss and his aides, Kol and Arridor are huddled together, up to no good. Arridor has a syringe and is extracting from Goss's neck (with considerable pain to Goss) some fluid.
 Devinoni rings the chime. The door slides open to reveal a very sexy lady... Deanna Troi, her hair still down, a lovely dress...
 Looking around with a critical eye.
 Mendoza ENTERS, walking unsteadily... sweating, looks a bit dizzy. Beverly notices, steps up.
 Picard and Riker are with the three Ferengi.
 Mendoza is unconscious on a diagnostic bed. Two MEDICAL ASSISTANTS tend to him.
 Well, I guess you'll have to fill in for him, Number One.

 The spectacular ride through the light show. A spectrum of primary colors are flowing in waves at the shuttle. There is a beautiful symmetry to these effects. A sense of something perfectly in balance.

 The shuttle continues to move through the light show.
 I'm picking up an increase in accretion matter filtering in from the terminus.
 Calm. Quiet. A sharp contrast to the excitement of the last shot. No visible sign of the wormhole... and then suddenly the shuttle bursts out of "nowhere" ... a beat later, the Ferengi pod follows...
 As it stabilizes.
 Our condition is no concern of yours, Enterprise shuttle. We are competitors in this venture, not partners. Ferengi pod, out.
 Happy landings to you too.

 DaiMon Goss, this is Devinoni Ral...
 The wormhole is not visible... but a tiny image of the shuttle suddenly appears out of nowhere...
 This is Shuttle nine... reporting back... barely.
 Acknowledged, Shuttle nine. Main Shuttlebay, prepare for final approach.
 As the door opens to reveal Troi. She reacts as she sees...
 A look.
 When do you leave?
 The two-man Federation scientific outpost has been looted -- stripped of all equipment. Instrumentation panels have been ripped from the walls; wave guides dangle aimlessly. Piles of crates, shelves and shattered scientific equipment are all over the floor, blocking easy movement...

 FADE IN:
 MEDICS are tending to the two scientists. Beverly's analyzing the bloody piece of metal. Picard, Riker and Data ENTER. Beverly reports:

 Picard, Riker, Troi, Data, Wesley, Worf.
 Riker, Worf, GEORDI, and Data MATERIALIZE in the midst of a "junkyard" of high-tech equipment scattered about.
 Ambush!
 as THREE GATHERERS (BRULL, TEMAREK, and one n.d.) -- armed with phaser rifles -- pop out from behind a ridge and take aim at the away team. (Like their Acamarian cousins, the Gatherers are muscular humanoids with a as a PHASER BLAST just misses them.

 Any insights, Counselor?
 A few yards away, Volnoth passes Yuta, taking a second look at her, as if she's vaguely familiar. Yuta looks calmly back at him. Volnoth walks off.
 as Yuta turns a corner, is out of sight of Riker and the others. She continues walking until she comes upon:

 Brull looks at Riker curiously --
 looks from Temarek stripping the corpse to Brull, can't conceal her distaste.
 Is there anything you need to bring with you, Brull?
 Orbiting Gamma Hromi Two.
 Picard, Riker, Troi, Data, Wesley, Worf. Brull ENTERS, escorted by Worf. All eyes are on Brull, who in turn eyes the crew with suspicion and curiosity.
 as Brull crosses to helm, looks over Wesley's shoulder. Wesley indicates the panel.
 Relaxing at a table are Picard and Marouk, with Yuta and the bodyguard close by.
 as a bartender hands Brull a drink. Brull takes a slug, looks around, sees Wesley in the corner, starts toward him.
 As Brull steps up to Wesley's table, sits down, helps himself to some of Wesley's snacks. Wesley's taken aback, but tries to be polite.

 Beverly is frowning with concentration as she works at a computer station. Riker ENTERS.
 FADE IN:
 Riker's alone, in the midst of a conversation with Data who's on the bridge.
 Picard, Troi, Data, Wesley, and Worf are at their stations. Brull ENTERS from the aft turbolift, occupied by a security officer, looks at the viewscreen.
 The Enterprise's phasers BLAST away, making a direct HIT on the Gatherer ship's shields.
 As before.

 Chorgan sits behind a large table, his Gatherer guard standing protectively behind him. There are two empty seats on the other side of the table.

 Starting on Yuta who stands nearby as the negotiations continue... pulling back to reveal Marouk at one end of the table, and then on the far opposite side, Chorgan with his Gatherer guard and Brull standing behind him. Picard is at the middle of the table. The discussion is heated:
 obediently pours brandy. Picard takes a conversational tone, both to give the combatants a respite and to melt some of the ice that still exists between them:
 Riker MATERIALIZES, phaser in hand. Everyone's astounded. The Gatherer guard goes for his phaser rifle. Riker FIRES, stunning the guard. Chorgan, bellowing, starts to get to his feet.
 Chorgan and Marouk are stunned. Yuta calmly explains:
 as the first signs of regret cross her face.
 as Yuta whirls, reaches to touch Chorgan -- and Riker FIRES.
 Silence. No one moves. Slowly, Chorgan stands.
 His haunted expression tells us he hasn't heard a word of Chorgan's...
 Riker's sitting alone at the bar, gazing into an untouched drink in front of him. Picard ENTERS. takes a beat to study him, then proceeds to sit down next to him. After a beat, Riker glances up, knows why the captain is there, nods an acknowledgement... there's not a lot of eye contact.

 As Picard, Riker and Data huddle over it... The Enterprise is clearly labeled and shown as a steady dot, and a flashing point of light in the Zone shows the Romulan vessel.
 Open hailing frequencies.
 A ROMULAN SCOUT SHIP is moving toward us. In the b.g. a ROMULAN WARSHIP suddenly DECLOAKS.
 FADE IN:
 The Romulan scout ship is overmatched... the warship is relentless and it FIRES TORPEDOES at the smaller craft. One of the torpedoes finds its mark.
 As before... watching the viewscreen. Data has moved to ops.
 SETAL, a Romulan male of about fifty (human) years of age is sitting at the controls of his small ship. There is evident damage in his bridge.
 Geordi at the console... supernumeraries in the b.g.
 The Enterprise is near the scout ship, which is drifting.
 The Romulan warship slows as it approaches the Enterprise and the scout ship, and then stops. The ships face each other.
 On the viewscreen, the Romulan warship sits facing the Enterprise.
 The Romulan warship turns and goes back the way it came... CLOAKING as it goes...
 A supernumerary is at the controls as Riker and Worf arrive.
 The figure of Setal MATERIALIZES on the platform. He wears a Romulan uniform with no insignia. His neck is injured, but he appears otherwise unhurt. Setal looks about for a second.
 The two crafts in space.
 A guard stands behind Setal as he tells his story to Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, Geordi. The Romulan is nearing the end of his account. He speaks with great fervency. A man demanding to be heard. Picard listens with a decidedly even expression.
 BEVERLY administers to Setal's neck as Riker questions him. Worf and the security guard stand nearby.
 The doors open and Setal is escorted in by Riker... an n.d. security guard remains outside the door. Setal looks over his new home, unimpressed by what he sees. Riker shows him the food slot.

 The debriefing takes place on a raised platform in the middle of the room. Setal sits across from Riker and Troi. An n.d. security guard (the same one we've seen before) stands nearby.
 With time code.
 Geordi with Picard, Data and Beverly at a monitor.
 The scout has sustained engine damage... forcing it to drop to point-six-one-five impulse power... for all intents and purposes he's finished, dead... the warship should overtake him... only it doesn't. Point two-six seconds later, the warbird slows to precisely the same speed...
 Three times... three speed fluctuations... the warship always kept its distance... I don't think they wanted to catch up.
 FADE IN:
 Holding position.
 Feeling trapped, Setal paces around the room.
 Picard is drinking tea as he plays back another communique from Starfleet. (It is likely that Picard got little rest the night before and he looks a bit tired.)
 A grim-faced Admiral Haden.
 HOLD a beat on his reaction, aware the Enterprise has moved closer to war. There is a chime.
 Setal is tired of answering questions.
 Which is now at full crew. Picard standing at command, Data at Ops, Worf at Tactical and supernumeraries at Conn and other stations. The atmosphere is tense.
 Stock shot of probe being fired off.
 The probe moving away on the Main Viewer. Data checks panel.
 Data and Geordi. Geordi is working at the console as if the first readings from the probe are sent back and analyzed. We see a computerized rendering of Nelvana Three, a grid is placed over it, graphs of raw data appear and disappear... as they work...
 Picard, Geordi, Data. They are revealing the surprising results of their probe analysis.
 Setal, alone at a table nursing some exotic alien concoction and mournfully contemplating the starfield out the viewport. The n.d. security guard sits nearby. Setal feels himself being stared at. Looks up to find:
 observing him from the next table.
 Data is rapidly keying a program into the Holodeck's Com panel. A skeptical Setal watches closely. The security guard remains in the b.g. He steps away from the com panel.
 CLOSE ON Setal and Data as they stare at the Holodeck's recreation of Romulus. (An exotic vision to be determined later.) Setal reacts, pleased with what he sees.

 The ship at warp speed.
 Jarok, sitting on his bed, lost in his personal agony... glances out his window...

 Entering the Nelvana system, the ship drops out of warp... a stellar light revealed from a planet crossing in front of the star suggests a dawning to this day of battle... and the thoughtful viewer may remember Shakespeare's words from the teaser.
 Jarok waits and wonders.
 Riker moves to look over Worf's shoulder as he continues to monitor the tactical sensors.

 The ship moves into orbit Nelvana Three.
 Picard and Riker on their feet now, standing between conn and ops studying Nelvana III.
 Turning course... but as it turns suddenly three Romulan warbirds UNCLOAK...
 Three Romulan warships uncloaking... coordinates... They're firing photon torpedoes...
 The Enterprise is struck by the torpedoes from all three ships....
 Shaking from the impact...
 Reveals the same Romulan commander (TOMALAK), the smug bastard who confronted Picard at Galorndon Core.
 Surrounded by the three Romulan ships... and suddenly the Romulan ships are surrounded as three Klingon Birds of Prey MATERIALIZE.
 Klingon vessels are armed and ready, Captain.
 The Romulan warships DISAPPEAR. Klingon ships remain.
 Mister Worf, extend the appreciation of the Federation... and my personal gratitude... to the Klingons.
 Data and Picard urgently on the move... reaching an doorway where a guard stands... several medical technicians, Beverly and Riker are already inside....
 Jarok is on the bed, dead, lying face up, eyes closed at peace. To Picard as he ENTERS --
 A cluster of low buildings, a bud of civilization whose outlying roadways vein a vast plain.
 PICARD and RIKER are with NAYROK, the Angosian leader, in the rotunda of the senate building. The Angosians take their civic duty very seriously and the senate is considered a repository of wisdom and law. Various government officials and petitioners pass by, either in deep discussion or thoughtful meditation.

 Nayrok returns, his face has a look of concern...
 DATA is in command. GEORDI, WORF, and WESLEY are on the bridge. Supernumeraries.
 A small ship, as well as an asteroid, are visible in front of the planet.
 Moving toward the transport vessel... which disappears behind the asteroid.
 On the main viewscreen, we see that only a small piece of the ship appears on the other side of the asteroid.
 Only the asteroid remains on screen. The ship is gone. Data reacts... looks at his sensors... looks at the screen.
 Picard and Riker have returned, are listening to Data's explanation. Other personnel are there as before.
 We've identified the prisoner, Captain. His name is Roga Danar. His criminal record is too long to go into. But you must be aware that he is given to bouts of uncontrollable violence.
 of the planet, over the north pole, we can see magnetic interference which Data tunes out, revealing an image of a craft hovering there, hiding...
 There he is, Commander. You were correct.
 The tractor beam shoots out from the Enterprise towards the tiny half-ship, which begins to turn to face the Enterprise.
 Data checks his instruments.
 The tiny ship is now facing the Enteprise. It is slowly approaching within the tractor beam.
 No longer enveloped in the tractor beam, the transport vessel hurtles head on towards the Enterprise, then skids off the invisible shield, away from the ship.
 He's bounced off our shields.
 A tiny, cylindrical object is just visible.
 Yet there are still no life form readings.
 TWO ARMED SECURITY OFFICERS wait with the transporter engineer. All eyes and weapons are trained on
 It glitters to life. An image begins to materialize. ROGA DANAR stands before them. Haggard. On the edge. A dangerous gleam to his eye, like a frightened, trapped animal. Without wasting a second, Roga aims his rifle and pulls the trigger. Nothing happens.
 fire their phasers... he's so quick, one shot misses him... the other connects with him in mid-air but he still lands on the security guard, takes him out, rolling off him, hit by another phaser shot, growls with pain, sags, then pulls himself back up and leaps at the second guard...
 They come crashing through from the Transporter Room... Roga and the guard wrapped up together, fighting for control of the guard's phaser... the transporter engineer comes from behind, grabs Roga... who throws him backwards hard against the wall...

 He looks down at the enraged face of Roga still struggling, helpless now.
 continuing to orbit the planet.
 Picard at command, Worf at Tactical, Data at Ops, Supernumerary at Conn. The prime minister on the main viewscreen... Riker ENTERS during the conversation... his arm repaired.
 Riker moves to Data...
 High security is evident. A guard is stationed outside the cell. The room is divided by a glowing rim, indicating an activated invisible forcefield.
 Lying on a bed, Roga borders between consciousness and unconsciousness. He tosses from side to side, tortured by a nightmare.
 Troi walks down the corridor towards her quarters, slows as she senses something.
 Roga's mental pain has intensified. His face is beaded with sweat. He moans in anguish.
 reacts, turns around and heads back in the direction from which she came.
 Roga's eyes open, he sits up abruptly on the edge of his bed, recuperating from the demons of his subconscious, turns to see Troi standing there outside the divider. For a beat, he has to shake himself back to reality... their eyes meet.
 Troi and Picard.
 Troi ENTERS, goes to Data who is working at an Aft Station. Worf is at his station. Otherwise supernumeraries fill the posts.
 A military file... including a list of campaigns in which he fought...
 studying the screen...
 Danar looks up to see Troi arriving... he is even calmer than before.
 Picard, Riker, Troi, Data, Beverly.
 Roga is on his bunk, eyes open, looking up... glances over and sees Data looking at him.
 Picard, controlling his displeasure, talks to Prime Minister Nayrok on the viewscreen. Troi observes.
 Roga and Data are still talking, the atmosphere more relaxed than before...
 An Angosian transport ship is now in proximity to the Enterprise.
 Riker, Data, Wesley, Worf, supernumeraries. On the viewscreen are two Angosians -- WAGNOR and his first officer. Picard faces the viewscreen.
 Roga is on one side of the room; Troi, Worf, and three security guards are on the other, phasers ready for the least sign of trouble. Worf's insignia BEEPS.
 as the transporter chief works the console.
 Roga makes a final leap out of the beam and an EXPLOSION fills the room. When the smoke clears, Troi, Worf and security are on the floor, dazed... he is gone.
 FADE IN:
 Picard, Riker, Data, supernumeraries.
 Worf, Troi, and the security guards are picking themselves off the floor. Worf taps his insignia:
 Picard and Riker exchange a look.
 as Roga calmly moves through it, phaser in hand, senses alert. He peers around a corridor. A security guard stands nearby the glowing rim of a forcefield. Roga ducks back around the corner. What to do? He approaches a turbolift. Its door OPENS. Roga hesitates -- then enters the turbolift.
 Picard, Data, supernumeraries.
 (Not the same corridor we've just seen.) Worf and a security guard are facing a turbolift, standing well clear of the door with phasers levelled at it. Worf taps his insignia:
 (Same one we saw Roga in before.) The security guard still at his post. He hears a sound, turns... it's Roga, who dispatches him quickly with a blow to the neck. The Security Guard crumbles. Roga quickly kneels beside him, grabs hold of one of the guard's hands and presses a finger to his communicator.
 Geordi and two engineering crewmembers are sprawled unconscious.

 Sir -- someone in Engineering is attempting to override the security system lockout.
 as Danar moves isolinear chips around.
 as Data compensates on his console. With each "move," Data is more impressed with Danar's skills.
 as Danar crosses to the reactor core.
 as Roga quickly ascends the reactor core, disappears.
 Data works his console.
 Worf and two security guards ENTER. Geordi and the two engineering crewmembers are slowly coming around.
 Roga is walking through a Jefferies Tube.
 Geordi's sitting up, shaking off a phaser stun.
 Roga continues walking through the tube. He reaches an intersection where many wave guides and conduits come together.
 Reading another open access panel...
 Roga making quick adjustments in one of the access panels.
 Data notices a new reading on his panel.
 Roga is working at the transporter console when gas begins to rush out from the floor and ceiling. As he reacts --
 Sensors show Anestazine concentration of seventy parts per million within the cargo bays.
 Worf and two security guards stand outside the entrance to one of the cargo bays, phasers ready.
 They enter and spread out, moving through the assorted cases, boxes and supplies piled all around the room.

 as Worf and the two security guards listen.

 As the door CLOSES, the two security guards can be seen EXITING into the corridor.
 as an unarmed Roga emerges from his hiding place -- and at the same moment, Worf emerges from his hiding place, phaser aimed at Roga.
 as the phaser reaches overload and EXPLODES.
 as the lights FLICKER and the ship SHAKES. Worf's thrown off balance for a split-second -- and that's all Roga needs. With a lightning move, he disarms Worf -- the phaser goes skidding across the floor -- and the fight is on.
 Explosion in Jefferies Tube section T-nine-five. All external sensors are inoperative.
 as Roga and Worf battle. Roga fights like a cornered tiger, finally gets the upper hand, drops Worf with a massive two-handed blow. Worf sags, nearly unconscious. Instinctively, Roga prepares to deliver a death blow -- but stops himself at the last second, runs off toward the transporter console.
 Roga taps the face of the transporter console as he runs past it; the console and the pad spring to life and energize. Roga jumps onto the pad and DEMATERIALIZES.
 as Roga MATERIALIZES in a compartment aft of the cockpit, opens the door. In the cockpit, Wagnor and his first officer turn, are stunned to see Roga...
 Two security guards have joined Worf, who is still staggering from his fight with Roga. Worf opens a panel on the transporter console, sees that a phaser has been jerry-rigged into the circuitry. He taps his insignia:
 Data is working his console with little success.
 First officer's log, supplemental. We are continuing to repair damage to the ship's sensors following the escape of the Angosian prisoner Danar. He is still at large.
 Hours later. Worf has returned to the bridge. Riker is with him at Tactical. Troi is there too.
 Yes, Prime Minister.
 Leading the way...
 Outside the transporter room... moving... Picard with Troi and Data... followed by Riker and Worf...
 Nayrok and a group of TEN ANGOSIAN SENATORS have gathered in the rotunda... Zaynar is passing out phaser rifles... the men look at the weapons in their hands as though they've hardly seen them before.
 Roga comes bursting through the door... he carries a phaser weapon... he walks toward us... a few beats later, more figures appear, firing as they enter... entering through doors, from the roof, windows, until a dozen veterans, all armed, are in the building... some have been wounded in the prison break... bloodied arms and legs... bandages...

 The away team enters... Wesley is at Conn.
 As it warps away to a new adventure.
 The Enterprise in orbit around a planet.
 Shops, a cafe, people strolling. A modern community. Beverly, Data and Worf are walking through the plaza.
 DATA, WORF, BEVERLY at a table... already reacting, Beverly on her feet, moving to help... Worf concerned for her safety...
 A scene of chaos. Shattered glass lies glittering on the pavement. Dust and debris from the explosion is settling. A jet of some escaping gas pours from a broken pipe. Three people are down, all of them showing blood.
 ENTER. Beverly starts to move to the first victim, but an officer draws a phaser, and blocks her way.
 Captain, there has been an incident.
 Picard and Riker at their usual stations. Supernumeraries at Conn and Ops.

 The WAILING of emergency vehicles is much closer. Beverly continues to treat the wounded. Worf is running tricorder scans of the buildings. Data moves to him...

 Picard, Riker listen to Data and Worf's report...
 A perimeter of light holds the stygian darkness at bay. In some places movable screens augment the natural stone wall which have formed to create a sense of privacy.
 who has just heard the news. Pulling back to reveal...
 Alexana Devos, a striking woman in her late thirties, meets with Picard and Riker. (This is the same woman we saw in the teaser.) Tall and athletic, she is a natural born leader. But she is also a woman under great pressure, caught up in a struggle that she's no longer sure she can win. Trying to deal with a hundred problems at once has left her preoccupied and driven and almost burned out. She is sitting down at a desk littered with isolinear reader chips. On one wall are monitors that provide a running text of current police activity. She studies them intently.
 As before, Finn enters with a plate of food. Same line
 For the first time, we see full breadth of the rebel camp... as Finn and Beverly move by, a pair of children, one watches while the other cleans a weapon... people look over at Beverly, exchange looks with Finn who nods confidently -- he's got this under control.
 Alexana and Riker are studying files on the wall monitors. A seemingly never-ending inventory of names, addresses and police records.
 Beverly is finishing her examinations, as the terrorist boy assists her.
 Finn is chatting off to the side with some of his friends... sees that she's finished, breaks off and moves toward her... She moves away from the patients...
 At the pool table, Wesley and Data are examining one of the Ansata armbands... that they have opened...
 ENTERS, having overheard the last two speeches...
 It's a round-up. Uniformed police officers have people stopped.
 As the waiter we saw in the teaser is taken into custody. He glares at Riker and Alexana as he's taken away.
 This is no way to live.
 The infirmary. Beverly is trying to ease the three patients who are suffering from the dimensional effect. She is suffering with them and for them, because there's nothing she can do except make them comfortable. She administers a hypo to the young woman, then sits next to her on the bed, and clasps the girl's hand. The terrorist boy is eager to assist.
 As she becomes aware of the scrutiny. She looks up, annoyed, and notices Finn.
 It is a very fine sketch of Beverly's hands clasping the girl's.
 Riker and Alexana have just finished interviewing one of the detainees from the round-up. He stares sullenly at them as Alexana dismisses him with:
 Picard is standing by Data who is working at Science One. Supernumeraries at Conn, Ops and Tactical.
 Finn is sketching again... studying Beverly as she works among the patients...
 is of Beverly...
 acknowledges away the waiter, moves toward her...
 Two crewpersons walking down the corridor. The SOUND of the inter-dimensional transporter, and an armed Ansata terrorist APPEARS. She opens fire, and one crewperson goes down... she turns and runs...
 Picard and Troi at Command. Wesley at Science One. Worf at Tactical. Data at Ops. Supernumerary at Conn.
 Geordi is in his little side office. Red Alert is sounding. Geordi leaps to his feet, and starts moving toward Engineering proper. A couple of techs in coveralls pause in their work on the main warp drive, and also react to the red alert.
 Intruders in Engineering...
 The man on the upper level tosses down a satchel charge. The second terrorist slaps it on the side of the warp chamber. It clings like a limpet, and the band on the edge LIGHTS. It is PULSING and emitting a BEEP in a climbing cadenza. The gunmen VANISH, and Geordi charges back into Engineering.
 As before.
 Stand by... I'm trying...
 His signal... ?
 Geordi yanks off his communicator. He slaps it onto the device as he pushes it out of Engineering... and ducks back for cover... The sound of the bomb has become an almost frenzied SCREAM.
 The bomb MATERIALIZES and EXPLODES.
 As before. The tension is palpable. Picard is on his feet.
 Geordi leans against the wall, and touches a companel.
 More subspace reflections...
 moving at him... the captain gets in a good hard lick before Finn grabs him in a bearhug... a major struggle ensues as Data leaves his post, charging...
 Picard is led by two terrorists into the alcove... as Beverly looks up and their eyes meet...
 Riker stands at command, and bleakly surveys the bridge. Alexana and Troi are at his side. Geordi is at Engineering, and Wesley and Data look on from Science One. Supernumeraries at Conn and Ops.
 Picard is seated on the camp bed. His hands have been cuffed behind his back. Beverly is tending his battered face. Picard is stunned... impossible to believe all this... reliving the nightmare for her...
 to see Finn has entered... hands shoved into his pockets.
 Troi is on her way to her quarters when suddenly there is a SOUND, LIGHT, and Finn appears (O.S.). As Troi reacts, Finn lifts a hand, recovering a beat from the pain.
 Wesley and Data check their readings at Science One. Then Wesley turns to Riker and Alexana who are at Command.
 Wesley, Data, Riker and Alexana are gathered about Science One.
 Finn walks over as Beverly treats the wounded... he's carrying his sketch pad.
 A secluded area, somewhat shielded from the main camp. Riker, Worf and Alexana... and three policemen... begin to move quickly forward...
 standing by the entrance to the main cavern... Worf and one of the policemen move quickly up behind them... slap tiny hyposprays against their necks. There is a quiet HISS, and the rebels slump. Worf and the policeman quickly pull the unconscious rebels into cover.
 The camp. People going about their business.
 As Riker scrambles back to his companions. Using hand signals he indicates where he believes the generator is located. Alexana nods, and draws her phaser. Leads her men into the darkness.
 moving into the alcove...
 Beverly returns...
 He is looking about wildly. He seems to make a decision, and he starts running for the alcove.
 Moving swiftly through the darkness. They are seen by a pair of terrorists and must overpower them on their way to the rescue... quietly, quickly... they take them down...
 Several terrorists run to get access to their phaser rifles... but as they do, Rutian police move out and cover them...
 She spots Finn. She moves after him...
 Finn ENTERS. Finn raises a phaser at Picard.
 At the mouth of the alcove... FIRES her phaser and Finn goes down... Riker and Worf arrive, move to Picard... the terrorists are all covered... Worf frees the captain from his cuffs...
 moves to Finn's body, checks his vital signs.
 As they come out. Riker exchanges a look with Alexana. And he is not harsh in this because he has shared her frustration, but still --
 standing there, holding a phaser rifle pointed at Alexana... hate burning in his eyes. A long beat.
 turns to the boy, she implores him with her eyes to give her the gun...
 C.U. on Wesley at Conn. Anxiously waiting.

 As it leaves orbit, we:
 The ship orbits Bre'el, a small, verdant planet orbited by a single moon, irregularly shaped.
 To include MAIN VIEWER. PICARD, TROI and RIKER in the Command Chairs. DATA and WORF at their stations. SUPERNUMERARY at Conn. On the Main Viewer is DOCTOR GARIN, a middle-aged man. He is obviously very troubled. Another SCIENTIST is at his side. In the b.g. various TECHNICIANS check monitors. It has the look of controlled chaos that fills a hurricane center during a big storm.
 GEORDI's at a console. SUPERNUMERARIES at various positions. The matter/anti-matter blender bubbling with power.
 The tractor beam flares out of the ship and grabs onto the small moon. The warp engines flare brighter as we apply power. The ship is trying to "plow" the moon into a higher orbit.
 As before. Picard and Riker looking at the viewer. The tractor beam holds the small moon. The moon does not move.

 Geordi reacts as the EFFECT rolls by...

 Picard ENTERS... Q, lying on his bunk, opens an eye...
 Q accompanying Data to Engineering.
 Q is with Data and Geordi, bending over, studying data, photographs at the pool table...
 Q and Data ENTER...
 This... is not a moment I've been looking forward to.
 Picard, Riker, Worf, supernumeraries.
 An amorphous mass, shapeless and changing.
 As people react to the cloud in view out the windows... Guinan reacts more than the others...
 As before.
 The light EFFECT has wrapped up Q's legs as he scrambles helplessly to escape... Data tries to assist but the light EFFECT effectively blocks him off...
 Geordi working feverishly...
 The light EFFECT is cut off... Q is freed... still terrified... rolling on the ground...
 Orbiting Bre'el. The plasma cloud is still ominously present.
 Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, Troi are on the bridge. Q paces nervously. His rhetoric remains, but there is an underlying fear that we've never seen from him.
 At the console...
 Mister Data, escort Q to Engineering... You will assist Mister La Forge.
 Data and Q... Q fuming...

 We need all the power we have to get out of the atmosphere, Commander.
 In orbit.
 Data is unconscious. Geordi and Beverly are both working on him... Picard, Riker and Q watching. Q seems confused, unsure of how to act or what to do.
 Picard sits at his desk, doing some busy work... sipping tea... a chime at the door...
 Geordi and Beverly are still working on Data who is conscious, but has not regained full use of his program...
 Q ENTERS, morose...
 Picard, Riker and Worf.
 The shuttlecraft moves away from the ship.
 The Calamarain in the distance... closing on the shuttlecraft.

 Open on side view of painting canvas. PICARD'S hand comes into picture from o.s. with paintbrush and works on the as-yet-unseen painting. PULL BACK to reveal PICARD sitting in an art class along with TWO SUPERNUMERARIES. They are all painting something that is presently o.s.
 shows that the class is painting a NUDE FEMALE MODEL.
 The doors OPEN and DATA ENTERS. He walks over to address Picard.
 Woman with flowers.
 Woman with violin.
 Picard tries not to betray his feelings as Data prepares to pronounce judgment.
 Picard slowly walks toward his painting; picks up a jar full of paint brushes, removes the brushes and proceeds to throw the bright red liquid onto his canvas.
 The ship is in orbit around a planet along with a small space station.
 Picard and Data ENTER from the turbolift. WORF at Tactical. GEORDI is at an Aft Science Station going over some information on the console. Data goes to Ops.
 Stand by, Commander. Engaging transport.
 Near the space station... which suddenly EXPLODES.
 Picard is moving toward the command center. In the b.g. the aftermath of the explosion is clearly visible on the Main Viewer. Data at Ops. Supernumerary at Conn.
 O'Brien working furiously at the console.
 The ship is in orbit as before. The space station is gone, but perhaps there is a faint cloud of particles or debris left over from the explosion seen earlier.
 Picard, Riker, Geordi... WESLEY is at Conn, Worf at Tactical, Data at Ops...
 Why was there a power drain before transport?
 Captain, the radiation and debris are consistent with an overload of the station's reactor core.
 As Inspector Krag MATERIALIZES. His curious eyes examine his surroundings, study the Klingon who greets him, and O'Brien behind the console.
 As before. Worf ENTERS from the turbolift along with Krag. Geordi is at the science station. Data and Wesley are at their accustomed stations. Krag is at all times soft-spoken, calm, rather British in nature (no accent)... qualities of the men of his race... but also fine qualities for an investigator. He is also quite relentless and determined to get to the truth.
 Picard indicates a chair for Krag as he seats himself at the desk. Krag remains standing and is waiting for Picard to make the first move.
 As before. Riker is sitting in command and trying not to throw glances at the Ready Room door. Picard ENTERS from the Ready Room. TROI is now on the bridge.
 As before.
 as Picard, Riker, Troi, and Krag approach the Holodeck doors.
 This is the main laboratory of the space station. The walls are lined with consoles, readouts, and computer equipment, most of which is inactive at the moment. Dominating the room is a large array of energy-focusing condensers, field coils, refractors, and so forth. Nearby is a medium-sized power reactor.
 The holograms of APGAR and TAYNA APPEAR, frozen in position.
 The Apgar and Tayna holograms "come to life" just as (holograms of) Geordi, and Riker MATERIALIZE in the lab (the away team beaming onto the station). (It's important to note that in Riker's presentation of the story, he is extremely business-like, almost flat in character... he is not as charming or personable as we know he can be. Nevertheless, for him, this is the truth.)
 entering... and it's a moment... like that first look that Bacall gave Bogart in "To Have and Have Not", she gives that look to Riker... female, thirties, strong, outgoing -- she takes your breath away. But Riker's hologram is quite unmoved.
 revealing she is bored beyond description, leaning languidly against a counter with her elbows back, supporting her and her chest thrust out rather invitingly, her eyes undress Riker.
 turning to Riker and smiling warmly.
 CLOSE on champagne being poured into three flutes. WIDEN to reveal Manua doing the pouring. Riker and Apgar are seated. Manua hands a glass to Riker; as Riker takes it, their hands touch. Manua smiles. Almost as an afterthought, she hands Apgar his glass.
 to reveal Picard, Troi, Krag, and Riker watching the holograms of Manua, Apgar, and Riker in the b.g.
 The door OPENS; Manua and Riker ENTER the tight quarters. A bed which has been decorated with a definite feminine touch.
 as it OPENS to REVEAL Apgar. Seeing Riker's arms around his wife, he snaps:
 Apgar slaps his wife hard across the cheek, she cries out, Riker is forced to intervene... Apgar takes a swing at him. Riker deflects the punch harmlessly. Apgar loses his balance and falls.
 I didn't see Doctor Apgar again until the following morning when he asked to see me alone. Commander La Forge returned to the Enterprise... Resume program.
 The holograms of Riker and Apgar stand in the main laboratory area.
 Freeze program.
 The holograms of Apgar and Riker VANISH, and reappear in the positions just prior to Riker's departure. Riker taps his insignia...
 reacts as we:
 FADE IN:
 Data, Geordi and Wesley are gathered around Science One looking at monitors displaying information. Worf is at Tactical. Supernumeraries at Conn and Ops.
 A section of wall about the size of a quarter has melted. A tricorder is run across the spot. Pull back to reveal --
 Geordi, and Wesley in the deserted corridor, checking tricorder readings.
 The Holodeck doors open to reveal Krag escorting in Manua. She reacts, stops as she sees the lab recreation. She is as beautiful as Riker described, but is dressed quite conservatively and does not ooze sensuality. She is in fact a grieving widow.
 As she comes over --
 The witness, the accused and the observers at the table. Frozen on stage is Manua and Apgar alone... heading through the living area... she is straightening out his tie (or whatever accessory is appropriate)...
 visibly gasps at this sight. Krag studies her, decides she's ready to proceed.
 The figures unfreeze... and Manua continues to adjust her husband's appearance, brushing off his suit, etc... he is impatient, bitter and defeated. As she speaks she punctuates her words with encouraging little touches to his hand, cheek, etc.
 MANUA ENTERS.
 Manua handing a glass of champagne to Riker who is standing close at her side. She crosses to her husband, who is seated on the couch, and gives him a glass.
 Riker is surveying the tiny room. Manua, who stands behind him, and very close to the door, is uncomfortable.
 As Riker can't take this anymore, and he stands.
 The door OPENS to REVEAL Apgar. Seeing his wife in Riker's arms he snaps:
 in the gallery.
 Beverly, assisted by a NURSE, is examining a CREWWOMAN'S arm.
 As Beverly guides the others out, move to find the wall is melting...
 FADE IN:
 Geordi and Wesley are examining the melted spot in the wall, (which is about the size of a basketball) with tricorders. Picard, Riker, and Beverly are listening to Data's report.
 Picard is already inside as Riker ENTERS.
 Close on Tayna while Picard, Riker, Krag and Troi look on.
 As the door opens to reveal Apgar, we can see Riker and Manua in the same basic position that they have been in the other flashbacks... her dress is off, Riker's arms around her... here, though, they are fully embracing in a passionate kiss, both on fire... they react as...
 in a rage...
 shaking his head...
 And then Doctor Apgar came to find you...
 Apgar and Tayna are alone in the lab. Apgar is very distraught and upset.
 Computer, freeze program. What happened next?
 Captain, I have established motive, method and opportunity. In any court in the Federation, it is enough to warrant the extradition of the accused. I await your decision forthwith.
 Picard and Troi.
 Geordi, Data, and Wesley are at one of the aft science stations. Picard ENTERS from the Ready Room.
 Still in orbit.
 Picard, Riker, Troi, Geordi, Krag, Manua and Tayna. (NOTE: Troi has already heard the explanation and should not be perplexed at what she hears.)
 The holograms of Riker, Manua, Apgar, Geordi and Tayna appear frozen as they did in Manua's version of the first lab scene...
 From Manua's story --
 From Tayna's story, Apgar and Tayna --
 The holograms of Apgar and Tayna disappear and are replaced by Apgar and Riker... as described by Riker...
 The holograms of Riker and Apgar disappear and reappear in different positions...
 Riker's hologram taps his insignia...
 Doctor Apgar killed himself... during his attempt to kill Commander Riker.
 Picard and Riker at their command stations. Everyone else in their usual positions. Troi is ENTERING from the aft turbolift. As she walks down to her chair she takes the long way so she can pass by Riker, and lay a hand briefly on his shoulder.
 WORF is seated at a table near one of the windows. The ship is traveling at WARP SPEED and the stars STREAK by. GUINAN comes over to Worf's table and delivers a drink to him.
 who both react to the view and the rift. Worf is already starting to rise when he hears...
 The ship hangs before the gaping rift in space.
 PICARD, RIKER, TROI in Command, WESLEY at Con, DATA at Ops. Worf ENTERS and goes to Tactical.
 He sees something on his tactical display and interrupts Data.
 Guinan is still looking out the window. Her puzzlement turns to alarm.
 The colors within the rift change, swirl, shift... a SHIP suddenly appears. It is barely visible and no identification of design or type is possible yet.
 His eyes fixed on the viewscreen... his voice strangely echoing...
 The ship within the rift is more clearly visible. It is unmistakably a starship of an earlier design than our own. It is very battered and beaten and looks as though it's been to hell and back.
 As before.
 The other ship, hereafter called Enterprise-C, can be seen and the heavy damage is apparent.
 N, C, C, one-seven-oh-one... C. U.S.S.... Enterprise.
 Enterprise-C in f.g. with name and designation number clearly visible. Enterprise-D in b.g.
 As before.
 Which is somewhat different than we last saw it... no civilians... about twenty UNIFORMED CREWMEN and WAITERS all carrying sidearms. Not as casual... more a military canteen/mess hall than a lounge.
 The battered starship drifts in space.
 The bridge has been heavily damaged. RED ALERT is in effect. FOUR SUPERNUMERARIES are lying dead on the deck plates or at their consoles. Smoke lingers in the air and burning panels add their own eerie lighting. Slumped in the captain's chair is RACHEL GARRETT, a tall, handsome woman that commands respect instantly. She is injured and barely holding on to consciousness. Riker, GEORDI, BEVERLY, and Tasha BEAM onto the bridge. Beverly moves to a crewman lying on the deck, Geordi goes to what's left of the engineering console, and Riker and Tasha go to Garrett.
 on Tasha and RICHARD CASTILLO, who is lying under the rubble. Castillo is ruggedly handsome, with jet black hair and fiery eyes. He is apparently just regaining consciousness, but otherwise does not look injured.
 As before.
 Riker appears on the viewscreen. He is standing on the bridge of the Enterprise-C.
 Survivors?
 Guinan ENTERS. She looks around the bridge. It looks familiar, yet somehow wrong to her... just like everything else aboard.
 Keep me posted, Picard out.
 FADE IN:
 As before.
 Guinan and Picard talking.
 Garrett is lying on a table while Beverly and a MEDICAL SUPERNUMERARY work on her. In b.g., TWO MORE SUPERNUMERARIES tend to FOUR INJURED ENTERPRISE-C CREWMEMBERS. Garrett is awakening, looks around the Sickbay. She's beginning to realize that this isn't just another starship. She looks at the instruments that Beverly is using with curiosity... they don't seem quite familiar to her. She looks over as Picard ENTERS.
 Angle favoring Riker working at a forward Ops console... other supernumeraries are repairing damage.
 At an aft science station... Picard looks over Data's shoulder as he studies a computer graphic on a monitor...
 As before...
 A Transporter CREWMAN is present as Tasha and Castillo MATERIALIZE. Castillo takes his first look at the Enterprise-D.
 as Tasha leads Castillo. Castillo's fascinated by everything around him. They pass several people in the corridor, some acknowledge Tasha.
 Captain Garrett convalesces on a biobed. She is awake, but remains weak. Beverly checks her patient's vital signs. Beverly moves off as Castillo and Tasha ENTER.
 Which has been converted into a war room atmosphere. The door slides open and Guinan ENTERS, pauses at the door, looking at --
 alone at the far end of the table filled with wartime displays and charts... they look at each other a beat. Picard is quite tense, a man who needs answers to make a difficult judgment.

 As she feels there's something really wrong with Tasha... we can see it in Guinan's eyes... and then...
 as Tasha turns and makes eye contact with Guinan... and she begins to smile, then reacts as...
 Guinan's eyes avoid hers... and it's only a moment but still...
 wonders what's wrong...

 cleans behind the bar, going out of her way not to look at Tasha until she passes...
 Picard, Riker, Geordi, Data, Beverly, Tasha. Picard has been briefing the others for the first time on Guinan's feelings... in measured words.
 As they EXIT the Ready Room... favoring Tasha as she hears --
 as she processes this... and the quick memory of the way Guinan was acting toward her, passes across her face... She pushes it away. The group splits up and we find...
 Data and Tasha ENTER. She is troubled by this turn of the events. Data notices.
 At corridor. Tasha pauses in the doorway.
 Tasha and Castillo work at the aft stations, doing additional checks...
 A Klingon bird of prey has appeared on the Main Viewer.
 Red Alert. Riker at command...
 Firing phasers...
 As the Enterprise-D fires a barrage, a shimmering EFFECT surrounds the bird of prey and it disappears.
 The Klingon vessel has re-cloaked, sir. I have no readings.
 Castillo is kneeling beside the body of Captain Garrett. Tasha stands helplessly beside him.
 On their stunned reactions.
 As before.
 Picard, Riker, Castillo, Tasha.
 Tasha and Castillo ENTER. A supernumerary mans the console.
 She's behind the bar... and as she turns and looks up, reacts as she sees --
 alone... looking at her...
 Picard at his desk, working... a chime.
 The CREW is busy at work, closing up patched-together consoles. Castillo is in command.

 Tasha ENTERS from turbolift. Alert status is RED. Castillo in Command, supernumeraries at their posts.
 as she also looks at the viewer. Her ship, her friends are about to make their final stand... without her. Linger on her look of concern then...
 Enterprise-C in b.g. The Enterprise-D begins to wheel around to face the imminent Klingon attack. The rift can now be seen in the b.g.
 The mood is tense. These are seasoned professionals getting ready for another round of combat in a long and hard war.
 THREE KLINGON BATTLECRUISERS in attack formation head for the Enterprise. The lead ship FIRES phasers.
 The ship ROCKS with the impact.
 The Enterprise-D FIRES TORPEDOES.
 As before.
 The Enterprise-D moves closer to the Enterprise-C in order to protect it from the Klingons.
 The ship is ROCKED by several hits. Riker works the Tactical console.
 as he works his console. Another HIT. Wesley struggles to maintain helm control.
 The ship sends out a firestorm of PHASER fire.
 The phasers punch through the Klingon shields and the ship EXPLODES.
 One enemy target destroyed.
 The room is filled with smoke and crackling consoles. SUPERNUMERARIES, some wounded or dead are in b.g. Geordi is trying to make his report through the confusion and damage.
 Geordi is cut off in mid-sentence as the bridge is ROCKED again.
 The ship is just about to enter the rift.
 All remaining power to defense systems.
 holding on to the Tactical console as the ship is hit by phaser fire...
 They press in closer for the kill and continue to FIRE at the Enterprise-D.
 The ship enters the rift and disappears.
 Match shot on Picard as we last saw him. It is not immediately apparent whether or not anything has changed or if the battle is still raging.
 which reveals the bridge of the Enterprise as seen in the Teaser. Everyone is back at their normal stations. The uniforms, the bridge itself and the people have returned to normal. Worf is back at Tactical; Troi is in her chair.
 Guinan is behind the bar, holding a drink she's just made.
 standing stationary in space.
 GEORDI and WESLEY walking swiftly down the corridor. At a connecting juncture TROI joins them. They are surprised when they realize they are all headed in the same direction.
 Oh, you are early. Just a moment please.
 Data kneels down and attaches the foot to the bottom of a leg. The toes begin to wiggle. Data's face is satisfied. He stands.
 (and the lab must be arranged so we can have a reveal here... we don't want them to see it as soon as they walk in -- perhaps the biobed set-up is faced away from the door, allows us to screen off line of sight to Lal as they enter.)
 Picard, has joined them, slowly circles the android while Troi, Geordi, Wesley and Data watch. The android shows nothing. It stands ramrod straight and perfectly still, and it displays no curiosity about the human which is inspecting it.
 Picard and Troi as they leave the lab. Picard is obviously disturbed.
 Data sits on the sofa... pull back to reveal Picard.
 Moving slowly down the hallway, passers-by react at the sight of the naked android... as a woman walks by, Lal studies her...
 Starting on Troi who has fallen asleep, sitting on the floor against a wall...
 to see Data has created a modest set with a mirror... in front of which stands Lal...
 An Andorian female...
 A human male...
 The human female.
 A Klingon male.
 They are all very interesting, Lal. Do you have a favorite?
 As Data puts the finishing touches on Lal... unseen in the biobed... studies his work... Troi ENTERS.
 Holding stationary in space.
 Data escorts Lal.
 Data and Lal seated at a table. Food is put in front of her... she picks it up with her hands... pauses as Data shakes his head no, shows her the fork in his hand... she imitates it.
 Wesley and Data throw and catch a ball as Lal observes. Data hands the ball to Lal who throws it gently to Wesley. He catches it and everybody is pleased...
 Lal studies the desk top viewer... her eyes staring at it... as Data points out words and pictures flashing quickly by.
 Picard, Worf, Wesley, Troi... Data is at Ops, doesn't see as Lal ENTERS...
 A similar setting to their first time here... she eats with a fork carefully but successfully and drinks without the beverage spilling out. Data observes and nods in satisfaction.
 Starting on Lal who is in the apparatus... pulling back to see that she is attached by the neural transfer equipment to Data. Wesley is observing.
 Picard is speaking to ADMIRAL ANTHONY HAFTEL on the viewscreen...
 Data and LIEUTENANT BALLARD. Ballard is seated behind her desk, there is a window with a twenty-fourth century shutter closed behind her.
 Data and Lal ENTER. After a beat...
 BEVERLY is at her desk, working. Data ENTERS.
 The lights are out... Picard is in bed... a signal wakes him up...
 Holding stationary in space.
 Data and Lal. Lal is back in the transfer device. They each wear small patches on their foreheads. LED's blink as the transfer is made. Over this the captain's log continues.
 Guinan is behind the bar. A few couples scattered around the tables. Data and Lal ENTER. Cross to the bar.
 Picard is seated at his desk. Data on the sofa.
 A scene that has taken place thousands of times in thousands of bars in the galaxy... a YOUNG ENSIGN is talking to SOME BUDDIES at the bar... he looks over the shoulder of one of the men at...
 with TWO ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMEN... one of them, a blonde catches him looking, smiles at him...
 watching from behind the bar...
 holding hands... Lal sees it...
 ENTERS. He checks the room for any friends. Spots Lal, takes a second look, and likes what he sees. Lal notices his interest. It parallels what we just saw. She glances at the flirting couple at their table, we see the decision made, and when she looks back to Riker it is with the same encouragement she saw the girl at the table give the ensign. He is drawn across the room like iron to a magnet.
 entering... reacts as he sees Lal pull Riker sharply toward her and kisses him to his great shock. Guinan sees it at the same time as Data does... they exchange a look... as Guinan moves to them...
 Data and Lal ENTER.
 Prepare to beam me aboard, Captain.
 As it the image of the admiral is replaced by a view of his ship.
 His face in CU, before he orders transport...
 No objective viewpoint could see it any other way...
 Picard, Data and Haftel. Data is demonstrating the transfer device. As he sets it aside he concludes,
 Guinan is behind the bar, while Lal serves customers. Picard, Data and the Admiral ENTER. The Admiral is obviously taken aback by their location.
 to reveal Guinan.
 Picard, Lal and Haftel. Haftel deceptively cordial. He smiles warmly to Lal. Lal is uncomfortable... this is rather like being called to the principal's office.
 Troi is working. A chime.
 Commander, you have Lal off to a wonderful start in life. And that's what being a parent is all about. But I have decided I must ask you to release her to me.
 Starting on Lal's face who has regressed dramatically... she is more like the first mannequin we saw... slow, measured movements, loss of comprehension...
 Haftel's ship nearby.
 Outside the lab. Wesley, Geordi, Troi, have been waiting a long time for news. Idle conversation has long ago ended. They react as the door slides open and Haftel comes out of the lab. His face is weary... he looks at the others and shakes his head.
 Data looks at Lal with an impassive face... and yet we must sense the extraordinary weight of his failure on his shoulders... she looks as beautiful as ever, standing here before him. And yet she barely can move or talk. There is very little left of her. After a beat...
 Lal suffered complete neural system failure at thirteen hundred hours. I have deactivated the unit.

 The two ships facing each other (STOCK FOOTAGE).
 PICARD and RIKER are walking along the corridor toward the Transporter Room.
 Picard and Riker ENTER. TRANSPORTER TECHNICIAN is waiting at the console.
 WESLEY at Conn, WORF at Tactical, DATA in Command. Picard, Riker and Kurn ENTER from the turbolift. Picard leads Kurn down into the Command area. Everyone watches to see the reaction as Worf and Kurn see each other for the first time. Worf is uncomfortable. Kurn runs his eyes over him... silently taking his measure of Worf... then looks away as if he'd seen nothing worth his time.
 The ship accelerates to full impulse power.
 Riker ENTERS, sees Wesley at a table and goes over to him. Wesley is staring into space with a look of unhappiness on his face.
 Kurn in Command, Worf at his station.
 Cruising at one-third impulse.
 Riker is inside as the door opens and Kurn ENTERS.
 As a hand puts a carving knife to work... and pull back to see Picard in a chef's apron, carving at the head of an elaborate buffet table. Kurn observes, in line near Geordi.
 As Kurn sits opposite Troi... the others follow to the table... Worf chooses not to be too close to Kurn.
 Kurn is standing near the table, looking over some information on a computer terminal. The door CHIMES.
 The ship is cruising at impulse speed.
 A short time later. Kurn is acting less like Worf's superior and more like his brother. But there is still tension between them. He goes to a window, looks out. He is thinking back over the early years of his life and we can see the shadows pass before his eyes.
 Picard and Worf. Picard has just learned the news, reacts with concern.
 Kurn, Riker, Troi in Command. Data, and Wes at their stations. Picard and Worf ENTER from Ready Room.
 The ship makes a sweeping turn and accelerates to warp speed.
 Worf is seated by the forward windows, lost in thought. Kurn ENTERS, sees Worf and then goes over to him.
 The ship enters orbit. The planet has a single large land mass, and the world is dominated by a vast ocean. The tilt of the planet's axis has created wild seasonal changes and the atmosphere should appear turbulent and showing extremes of both warm and frigid weather on the planet.
 A large, sprawling city that was once an enormous fortress. The architecture should reflect a soldier's sensibilities for ease of defense and Spartan decoration. The city is dominated by the Great Hall.
 A spare, simple room adjacent to the Great Hall, which can be entered through an ornate door. There is a table, chairs and a few decorations. It is basically a waiting room for the Great Hall. Picard, Troi, Riker, Worf, and Kurn BEAM IN.
 Worf, Kurn, Picard, Troi, Riker, ENTER. The hall is a parliament/supreme court/public square. One end of the room is dominated by a raised dais with chairs for the High Council. There is a large, open floor area and the floor itself is emblazoned with the triangular Klingon insignia. There should be small partitions to suggest that the room is used for a variety of functions. Several KLINGON SUPERNUMERARIES are present. There is a general buzz of noise which builds as our characters enter the hall. The COUNCIL MEMBERS, including K'MPEC and DURAS ENTER the Hall and take their seats at the dais. The council members are mostly older Klingons, with one or two young upstarts.
 FADE IN:
 As before. Worf still facing the council. K'mpec now stands and addresses Worf.
 Your father was a traitor! By posing this challenge, you are a traitor!

 Duras grabs the sash on Worf's chest.
 His eyes deeply troubled for his officer... knows it is time to leave.
 Picard, Riker, and Troi ENTER from turbolift.
 As before. Duras and Worf still face each other in the Hall. Worf's sash lies on the ground in tatters.
 They move off to one side of the hall where they can plan their strategy, but before they can speak, K'mpec approaches them. Worf and Kurn straighten up at the sight of him.
 as they move into a small cul de sac in the hall.
 he is watching for any move against him or Worf. A KLINGON WOMAN CLERK is routinely distributing PADDs to members of the council... laying them on desks, etc. As she comes to Kurn, she puts it on his desk and gives him a special look that points him toward the PADD, then moves off. He discovers a note underneath it... He reads it... glances at Worf... then heads out of the hall.
 As before.
 Data and Riker are at one of the Aft Science Stations looking at INFORMATION scrolling across one of the screens. Geordi stands nearby, watching their work with curiosity.

 What Federation starship was closest to Khitomer at the time of the attack?
 Kurn is waiting... after a few seconds, Duras approaches him in the tunnel. Kurn prepares for an attack.
 The ship is cruising in orbit.
 Kurn is lying on the operating table, post op. A MEDICAL SUPERNUMERARY is checking on him using the surgical clamshell. Beverly moves to Worf nearby. Worf's spirits are beginning to sag.
 Data, Riker and Geordi are still looking through the Klingon computer files at two science stations. Data calls Riker to join him...

 Riker, Data, Wesley, Geordi... Beverly ENTERS...
 Duras is at the apex of the insignia on the floor, addressing the entire hall. There is much noise and frequent interruptions by angry reactions.

 as he moves the hood enough so we can see him. He looks around and then sounds the door CHIME. After a few seconds, the door slides aside and Picard goes in.
 Picard ENTERS from the street. The home is small, yet comfortable. The furnishings should be in contrast to the martial decor of the rest of the planet... this is the home of an old woman with no need to proclaim power or strength. Picard looks around for a few seconds, lets his eyes adjust to the dimmer light.
 Picard has left the house and is heading back up the street when the two assassins suddenly burst out of a recess in the wall and attack Picard. They are wielding the same ornate weapons seen earlier.

 Someone is making their way through the crowd to the Council... Picard and Kahlest finally step forward. Worf reacts to the sight of the woman from his childhood.
 A small, private room with a few decorations and furnishings. It is the Klingon version of a judge's chambers. K'mpec, Duras, Picard, Worf, and Kahlest ENTER.
 Picard is waiting off to one side for something. The transporter EFFECT begins and Kurn beams in along with a MEDICAL SUPERNUMERARY who is helping him. Kurn is recovering from his injuries, but is still a little unsteady on his feet.

 PICARD is relaxing on a recliner-type chair, reading an antique leather-bound book. An empty brandy snifter is nearby. CLASSICAL MUSIC plays softly.
 RIKER, WORF, DATA, and supernumeraries are at their posts. Data reacts to something on his console.
 CLOSE on Picard as he slowly awakens and looks around windowless, rather featureless room. One door -- which is solidly shut.
 as he gets to his feet, taps his insignia:
 Worf and security team are at the captain's door. Worf touches the CHIME. No response.
 Picard crosses to the motionless Haro, kneels at her side, touches her carotid artery to check for pulse. Haro stirs, awakens -- realizes someone's close, and panics, reflexively swinging an arm at the stranger. Picard's ready for it, blocks the blow by seizing Haro's wrist, whispers to calm her:
 Tholl is sitting up, regarding Picard with a mixture of suspicion and disdain.
 as he moves around, inspecting the walls. Haro follows Picard, keeping a respectful distance.
 as Picard moves to the door, examines it. Next to the door is a small panel flush with the wall -- a key panel? It appears to be -- it's divided into a grid of sub-panels, each with an alien symbol upon it. Picard presses one; it lights up briefly and makes a short, annoying BEEP SOUND. He tries another -- same result.
 Riker, Data, WESLEY, Worf, supernumeraries. False Picard ENTERS from the turbolift.

 False Picard is leaning on his desk; Riker stands before him.
 Picard, Haro, Tholl. Picard is again examining the keypad next to the door. He thinks it over, starts pushing just one of the panels in a repeating sequence of numbers -- 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. Haro looks on with interest, Tholl with ill-concealed skepticism.

 as a FORM begins to APPEAR (ALIEN TRANSPORTER EFFECT).
 as Esoqq looks around with surprise -- plainly he has no idea what's happening to him. He sees the three others in the room -- and his face contorts with rage. He draws a weapon -- a mean-looking dagger or blade of some sort.
 Esoqq holds the knife threateningly. Tholl and Haro remain motionless as Picard tries to calm Esoqq:
 The poker game is on; Riker, Geordi, Worf, Troi, and Data are seated at the table, enjoying the game as well as the drinks and snacks. Troi has the largest pile of chips. Riker tosses chips into the pot.
 False Picard and Troi stand outside Data's quarters.

 Tholl, clear of the beams and unhurt, gets to his feet, concerned but helpless.
 False Picard, dressed in formal evening attire, sits across a table from Beverly -- looking lovelier than ever in her evening dress. Soft MUSIC and candlelight set the atmosphere. The captain and Beverly have finished their meal and are enjoying the last few sips of a dessert champagne. Beverly smiles.
 as False Picard leads Beverly to the middle of the room. He takes Beverly in his arms and they begin a slow dance. After a beat:
 as the captain holds her near... His arm curls around hers... They get closer... cheek-to-cheek. As they dance, the mood changes -- the sexual tension becomes undeniable. False Picard's arm tightens around her waist...
 Beverly stands in the corridor, confused. For a moment she hesitates, considers ringing the bell... then changes her mind, EXITS down the corridor.
 Picard, Haro, and Esoqq are back on their feet. Esoqq glares accusingly at Tholl, who's watching from several feet away.
 Getting steadily angrier, Esoqq advances toward Tholl. Even Haro is looking at Tholl with new eyes. Tholl's getting desperate:

 False Picard, Riker, Data, Wesley, and Worf watch the pulsar which fills the viewscreen.
 False Picard waits for Riker to speak first.
 Picard and Haro examine the circuitry in the bulkhead as Esoqq looks on. Tholl also watches, from a few feet away. Picard indicates a thick cable inside the bulkhead.
 Picard carefully sticks his hand through the opening and cuts the cable with Esoqq's knife. A sharp ARCING sound and a FLASH OF LIGHT -- that's all. Picard nods as if he expected exactly that, hands the knife back.
 Behind the open door is a solid, blank wall.
 As before. The pulsar's intense pulsating light bathes the area intermittently, adding to the tension. False Picard stands near his chair. Riker ENTERS from the Ready Room. False Picard watches Riker -- will Riker leave the bridge, or not?

 Picard MATERIALIZES. A glance at the blissful faces of the other guests only serves to convince him that it's going to be a long week.
 A woman, VASH, mid-thirties, striking good looks, moves away from the pond, where she has stood admiring the shrine of the Horga'hn. She casts a backward glance at the idols.

 Another perfect day at the Pleasure Haven. The temperature is the equivalent of a balmy eighty-three degrees Fahrenheit; a warm breeze prevents the heat from becoming oppressive, and the water (you'll have to take my word for it because we never get to see the ocean) is as clear and calm as a lake.
 Sitting in a lounge chair, trying to concentrate on the thick tome he's reading. It's not as simple as it would appear. First of all, it's not easy to relax with a couple locked in the throes of lust only a few feet away. For a private man like Jean-Luc Picard, such public behavior is distasteful at best. Then another couple comes running up from the unseen beach. The water from their still dripping bodies sprays over him. Annoyed, he carefully wipes dry his book.
 As he settles back down, a hoverball glides over to him and stops dead in the air only inches from his face. Picard tries to ignore it but the sphere emits an aggravating low level HUM. He casually tries to swat it away but it avoids his hand and darts away. Picard reopens his book... just as the hoverball makes an abrupt reappearance above his head. As he looks up:

 Sovak ENTERS the vault carrying a phaser rifle at the ready. He reacts to the Vorgons.
 Picard climbs out of a hole that has grown waist deep and five feet wide. Vash continues to shovel away -- under the watchful eyes of the Vorgons and an increasingly anxious Sovak.
 Vash gives Sovak a sympathetic look.
 Picard and Vash watch this sorry spectacle for a beat and then turn to leave.
 It is nearly deserted.
 Picard and Vash ENTER. Vash looks like a tired and defeated woman.
 Picard, back in the clothes he wore when he first came to the Haven, is packing his travel bags. (NOTE: He is now wearing his communicator.)

 TIGHT ANGLE ON DESOTO in the Hood's Ready Room.
 Smiling to Riker and Troi; DeSoto's put-on griping is an old song going back to when he and Picard served together as lieutenants.
 Nope. Starfleet's got new orders for you. This is top priority. They need the fastest ship in the fleet -- and the best people. That's you.

 of a RED SUPERGIANT STAR. Flashing around it in close orbit is a TINY, BRILLIANT WHITE light.
 Scientists have discovered that it is in the final stages of an alternating cycle of expansion and collapse, which will soon result in a supernova. However, the long-range unmanned probe which Starfleet sent to observe the process has discovered something much more --
 The new image is a SLENDER OBJECT which PULSES WITH LIGHT, of organic appearance. At the aft end of the object are two GLOWING ORANGE GRIDS -- clearly ENGINES. The whole surface of the thing is NETWORKED by faintly pulsing pale white ENERGY PATHS, suggesting something between lightning charges and a human circulatory system.
 Looks like a ship of some kind.
 Data, you're our resident honor student in exobiology. I'm assigning you to head up life sciences on this mission.

 where the curve of the SUPERGIANT STAR fills half of the screen. TIN MAN sweeps majestically into view, shimmering with the silver iridescence of an otherworldly fish. As it sails past the viewer POV, the fire of its engines can be seen. Tin Man is at least the size of the Enterprise. Picard RISES, gazing transfixed at the alien image on the Main Viewer.

 The Romulan has passed us, sir, and recloaked.
 Geordi is leaning over a console, locating a burnout.

 Worf, hail them. I cannot allow They won't listen to you!
 Tam LOOKS from Picard to the Main Viewer, like a TRAPPED ANIMAL looking for a place to FLEE -- or to MAKE A STAND. With sudden resolution he steps past the forward stations and stands directly before the Main Viewer.
 EYES CLOSED; a look of pained CONCENTRATION on his face.
 The ENERGY traces on its surface FLARE BRILLIANT WHITE, the first sign of response from the creature since its discovery. A NARROW RING OF WHITE ENERGY, like a SHOCK WAVE, RADIATES away from its surface in ALL DIRECTIONS.

 No. I don't believe that I do.
 Tam -- when you reached out to the alien, to warn it -- did you give any thought to this vessel? To the danger, however inadvertent, the creature might pose to our crew? Or did you simply react out of instinct?
 Captain --

 Data watches as Tam is now totally focussed on his communication with Tin Man.
 There is a large chamber twenty meters ahead.
 Tam smiles.
 As Data and Tam round a curve in the corridor, but they are brought up short by the ribbed and membraned wall. Tam stands for a moment. His eyes are blank, the stare wide-eyed. Suddenly the wall OPENS to admit the Betazoid and the android. Data looks in wonder at Tam who smiles.
 A small room narrowing at one end -- again, organic in appearance. The narrow end of the chamber the walls pulse and writhe. Darkness, shadows, and lights which brighten and ebb behind the flesh-like walls.

 Lieutenant ENDICOTT REGINALD BARCLAY THE THIRD slouches at the bar. Scattered around the room are HOLO-TROI, who sits provocatively at a table in her off the shoulder dress; HOLO-RIKER seated at the end of the bar and mumbling into his drink, OTHERS. There should be the suggestion of something bogus about the scene, like a bad John Wayne movie, rife with cliches and over-acting. Holo-Guinan walks over to Barclay... with a bottle of whisky and a shot glass.
 Barclay steps into the corridor, a much altered man. The hero of the hour has been replaced with a shy individual with a perpetual frown born of stress and unhappiness between his brows. He is hustling because he's late. Troi comes briskly around a corner. She's headed straight for him. He steps aside for her. Troi nods in greeting, gives him a kindly but perfunctory smile and moves on. We barely notice Barclay sigh as he moves on.
 O'BRIEN is operating the transporter console... several canisters MATERIALIZE. A couple of ENGINEERING TECHNICIANS (named DUFFY and COSTA) move the canisters from the transporter pad to an antigrav unit. Geordi is studying an open panel on the unit which is out of service... Riker is listening to him gripe about Barclay.
 as they see Barclay ENTER... moving to him... a throw-away piece of business -- Duffy discovers a canister with a trace of GASEOUS NITROGEN leaking from it.

 Barclay closes up the anti-grav panels, looks up at Geordi...
 La Forge to Engineering... I'll need more people in Cargo Bay Five... anyone you can spare. Out.
 Picard behind his desk. Riker and Geordi. There is a report on the computer screen on Picard's desk. Picard indicates the screen.
 Geordi ENTERS... the room is deserted now except for Barclay who is off to one side looking over the disassembled antigrav unit. It's open, the guts exposed as he traces circuits with a sensor. Geordi frowns to himself as he looks over to Barclay, whose back is to him.
 wrapped up in his mystery... Geordi moves up behind him, and as he pats him on the back...
 At warp.
 Geordi ENTERS with WESLEY...
 It appears that Barclay is in therapy with Troi. She sits, listening intently... Barclay pacing the office in front of her. When he speaks, it is forceful, without hesitation.
 Mmm, nice... but I'm in the mood for someplace a little more... unusual... Computer. Run Barclay Program Fifteen.
 A glade with a few small hills, rock formations, some trees, grass, a pond. As different as can be from the world Barclay lives in... peaceful, green, remote... a warm breeze flutters through the trees... Barclay takes a deep, cleansing breath... turns to see ---

 Data, Wesley, Geordi, Duffy seated at a table. All except Data are drinking various beverages.
 Moving at warp speed.
 Data and Geordi are examining the glass from Ten Forward with a tricorder and one of the consoles on the bulkhead. Barclay is in the b.g. working on some console.
 At the science station, starting close on the mangled glass... pulling back to find Riker listening to Geordi who has deliberately brought Barclay along. Data is there too. WORF is at his station. Picard is ENTERING from the Ready Room in the background.
 Guinan looks across the bar at Geordi.
 Close on the arch as it slides open to reveal Geordi who ENTERS and reacts as he sees the glade...
 as exquisite as a Gainsborough canvas... a swing suspended from a tree branch on which the image of a woman is swinging in flowing petticoats, a silent garment draped on the grass and spread with delicacies... a boy dressed as "Blue Boy" eating messily with his hands... as Geordi moves closer, he reacts as we reveal the woman and child to be Holo-Beverly and Holo-Wesley...
 Coming over the rise, backing toward him is Barclay (in uniform) ... in classic swordsmanship stance, his sword moving with lightning speed fighting off unseen adversaries...

 Barclay and Geordi at a table.
 O'Brien is setting a transporter test object, a cylinder three feet tall, six inches in diameter, on a transporter pad...

 Picard, Riker and Geordi are examining the residue of the test object.
 Troi is sitting, very much the way she was (and dressed the same way she was) in Barclay's fantasy. Barclay, on the other hand, is entirely a different man from his dreams... dreadfully uncomfortable sitting on the far end of the couch from her. Troi studies him sympathetically...
 A short time later. Geordi is working at one of the aft stations along with Data. Wes at Conn, supernumerary at Ops. Troi ENTERS from turbolift and goes over to Geordi.
 Geordi, Riker, and Troi turn a corner, head for the Holdeck.

 Under a tree sits Holo-Beverly in a very pastoral scene, skirts and petticoats billowing out. Troi, Geordi, and Riker approach. Holo-Beverly looks up at them coquettishly, and puts a finger to her lips. Barclay is asleep in her lap, snoring away.
 Riker, Geordi, Troi, and Barclay ENTER from the Holodeck. Riker's expression is furious. Troi looks sympathetic, but resigned, while Barclay looks incredibly embarrassed. He hangs his head slightly.
 I just couldn't keep my eyes open... I'd worked twelve hours on the power systems and then the transporter went down and...

 The Enterprise shuttlepod has docked and DATA emerges from the pilot seat.
 GEORDI is monitoring the situation from the Engineering Station. PICARD, RIKER, WORF, and WESLEY are at their stations.
 The Technicians have completed loading the shuttlepod and closed the hatch. Through the window, we can see a containment field (F/X -- nitrogen) promptly fill the trunk. Data heads for the pilot seat.
 Varria approaches Data and hands him a padd.

 Data is "unconscious" on the floor. With a jolt, he snaps back to functional status, sits up, runs a quick re-calibration.

 as the massive, vault-like door opens and Fajo and Varria ENTER. The door immediately shuts and locks behind them. Varria stays in the b.g. as Fajo crosses to Data, looks him over with great interest and delight. (Note: Fajo and Varria are wearing a small device on their belts... and they never get closer to Data than one meter.)
 Fajo doesn't move a muscle as Data advances toward him. The instant Data comes within two meters of Fajo, a GLOWING AURA appears around Fajo's body... Data stiffens, nearly loses control of his movements. It's all Data can do to stagger back from Fajo.

 Geordi and Wesley ENTER. A silent beat as they look over the room. The violin on a shelf. The covered easel.
 Everything is neatly arranged: an old leather-bound book, a pack of playing cards, a set of poker chips, the hologram base of Tasha Yar, and Data's medal case.

 Data is examining Fajo's collection, looking for something which might be of use to him. SOUND of door opening. Data whirls, braces himself -- this may be a chance to escape.

 Geordi is alone studying a monitor... he's tired, back hurts, been working for a long time... stands, stretches...
 Picard, Riker listen to Geordi...
 Fajo ENTERS. Fajo looks to his collection:

 Kivas Fajo, in the cell, paces the floor. He seems more annoyed than angry.
 The ship is in orbit around a red/brown planet.
 PICARD and RIKER are walking to the Transporter Room. They are in dress uniforms.
 There are FOUR CREWMEMBERS forming an honor guard on either side of the transporter stage. They stand at attention. O'BRIEN is at the console, as KI MENDROSSEN (a human -- fifty-five, stocky, comp), and SAKKATH (A Vulcan, early twenties) MATERIALIZE on the pads. They step off.
 SAREK and his wife, PERRIN (a human) MATERIALIZE. Sarek is indeed old, but immensely commanding. A genuinely regal figure. Perrin is much younger -- about Picard's age -- poised and charming, with an immediate warmth about her.
 Things haven't gone at all the way he expected. He doesn't look troubled, exactly -- only wondering...
 The room is currently dominated by a large bulky tank about chest high containing a gaseous/liquid revolting mixture. GEORDI, WESLEY, and a few SUPERNUMERARIES are busily connecting a complicated series of pipes and cables around the tank. There are a few pictures on the walls and a generic table with chairs. Wesley peers into the tank with disgust.
 The ship goes into warp.
 Picard and Riker (now in standard uniforms) at Command along with TROI. WORF at his station.
 The door CHIMES. The blinds over the windows are closed. As Perrin moves toward the door, we can see that she looks very tired, almost exhausted. She presses the control panel and the door slides open, revealing Picard.
 as she turns away from the door. Her face clouds slightly as she moves toward the closed door to the adjacent room.
 Sarek is kneeling on a angled stool (like a computer stool). His eyes are wide open, and his expression is not calm and distant, but conscious and troubled.
 The door slides aside and Perrin ENTERS. The easy, light manner that she showed to Picard is gone. This is a deeply worried woman. She goes over to Sarek and puts her hand on his shoulder. Sarek looks up at her.
 Geordi and Wesley are still working on the tanks. The supernumeraries are no longer present. The pictures and furnishings seen earlier have been removed.
 Riker ENTERS. He looks at the two of them as they glare at each other.
 The ship's concert has not yet begun, but SUPERNUMERARIES are filing into the room. On stage, a string quartet with DATA prominent among them, is tuning up.
 as they ENTER and move to their seats.
 including doorway. Sarek and Perrin have entered. Mendrossen is behind them and Sakkath is close by Sarek. Everyone in the theater stands.
 Data walks over to stage, nods to the other musicians and begins to play.
 Perrin and Sarek appear to be concentrating on the music while Mendrossen and Sakkath keep stealing glances at Sarek.
 The musicians are playing a new piece of music. Data is giving a perfect performance. This piece must be very emotional. (Note: it is the beauty of the music which creates the emotional response in the audience... a perhaps familiar melody that stirs memories.)
 We PAN across the gathered crewmen and we can see that they are caught up in the lovely music. END PAN on Sarek, who seems surprisingly moved.
 She is listening to the music. She suddenly senses something odd and looks around the room in puzzlement.

 Wesley ENTERS. Beverly is drinking tea and reading a medical journal on the terminal.
 Troi and Beverly are discussing the incident in Beverly's quarters.
 A few hours later. Data is giving Sakkath a tour of the bridge.
 O'Brien and TWO TRANSPORTER TECHNICIANS get drinks from the bar and head over to a table which is currently occupied by THREE CREWMEN wearing science uniforms. O'Brien gives the science crewmen a friendly grin.

 Picard, Beverly and Troi. Picard is quite shaken by this turn of events.
 Mendrossen is sitting in the chair before Picard. Mendrossen is sincere and easy-going.
 Sakkath stands near the Legaran tanks. And this is a man in turmoil. Logic tells him he cannot allow what is occurring to continue. He fears what will happen at the conference. Yet, he is dedicated to Sarek. These matters weigh on his mind as the doors slide open and Data ENTERS. There is a beat of silence as they glance at each other.
 Picard, Data, Riker at command. Wesley and Worf at their posts.

 Perrin is reacting to what Picard has told her... she is cold and imperious.
 He is standing in the doorway on the far side of the room. Mendrossen and Sakkath can be seen behind him, their faces grim.
 including Picard and Perrin. She looks away from Sarek's gaze... cannot answer.
 As before. Picard and Sarek facing off in the room. For all outward appearances, Sarek looks like the imposing figure of legend. Sakkath is standing very close to Sarek and is almost physically propping him up throughout the scene.
 As Sarek and Picard square off alone. Sarek will remain immobile throughout as Picard moves and paces. Picard is clearly unhappy at the prospect of the task before him.
 as they stare at each other. Sarek turns away... a defeated man. He begins to weep.

 The ship drops out of warp.
 Picard is looking out the window, deep in thought. Riker has just entered.
 Picard and Sarek are standing near the Legaran tank. Sarek is a little surprised.
 Picard is placing two chairs face to face in the center of the room. Beverly is standing next to him, holding a tricorder. She is obviously worried.
 Sarek slowly reaches out with his hand and places his fingertips on Picard's face. Picard's eyes close briefly then open again.
 Legara Four is visible below...
 Riker at Command, Wesley, Worf and Data at their stations.
 He has just emerged from the turbolift. He looks strong, confident, imposing. He is Sarek... yet he is Picard too.

 A busy place. Conference delegates from different worlds are here, including three Ferengi: TOG, FAREK, and NIBOR. In b.g., a MUSICIAN entertains the gathering, playing a complex RHYTHM on a strange percussion instrument. RIKER plays three-dimensional chess with Nibor as WESLEY looks on. PICARD, TROI, and DATA socialize with their guests as Log is completed:
 It is clear they are near the end of their game, and the Ferengi is in trouble. Captured pieces litter the table at Riker's elbow.
 talking with REITTAN GRAX, the Betazoid conference director.
 Lwaxana's plate is piled with food, her synthehol glass is refilled continually as she gives new meaning to the old Auntie Mame adage, "Life is a banquet." Between bites and sips, she plies her daughter with thought transmissions.
 as the other two Ferengi watch Mrs. Troi. Daimon Tog, the Captain, seems fascinated by this Betazoid female. Tog is tall for a Ferengi, although not by human standards, and Ferengi women probably find him as close to a "hunk" as their men ever get. He's talking with his companion and ship's doctor, Farek. In b.g., Lwaxana LAUGHS. Farek winces at the sound.
 as he seats himself at her table.
 to include a horrified Deanna. There is a pause as everyone waits to see what Tog will do. He is silent for a moment, then:
 On the way to her cabin, Troi encounters WORF. They walk together as Deanna continues to her quarters.
 Lwaxana lies with her eyes open as if unseeing. Unusual Betazed candles burn at each side of her head. The room lighting adds to the effect of her appearing dead, but actually she's in a meditative state. Betazed is visible through the window.
 Troi's not even sure where she's going; she just had to get out of there. And as she walks, she hears:
 Picard and Riker have been listening to a briefing from Data, Geordi and Wesley on equipment to be used in the next mission. Wesley is concluding his report.
 A 24th-century "city" -- technologically advanced yet so well blended in with nature so that the effect is relaxing and pastoral.
 A secluded spot in the greenbelt. Lush plants surround this open area, and a dirt path leads off into dense foliage. Riker and Troi are looking for something in the greenery. Their mood is light as they enjoy this brief shore leave.
 as his image COALESCES in a Ferengi TRANSPORTER BEAM.
 Riker jumps to attention. The others are equally surprised. Tog extends a bunch of sorrowful Ferengi daisies to Lwaxana.
 as Mister Homn returns, his container full of green berries. His lips are stained dark green -- he's been eating much of what he's picked. He looks around at the empty clearing -- where is everyone? Probably off playing a game, so he pops another uttaberry into his mouth while he waits for them to return.

 Typical of a Ferengi ship: an ill-designed, unattractive room. The furnishings are sparse. One end of the room opens into an area where a companel station is staffed by Nibor. A three-dimensional chess board is on the console. Separating this holding tank from Nibor is a lighted arch, suggesting a forcefield. Riker, Troi, and Lwaxana are unconscious. Riker is the first to come to, immediately going to Deanna and her mother.
 Another example of tasteful Ferengi interior decorating. Not a pleasant setting. Various pieces of strange and dangerous-looking equipment are everywhere. Compounds have spilled over and crusted on table surfaces. It's the kind of place you'd like to scrub down with Lysol. Troi and Lwaxana MATERIALIZE here, completely naked. Lwaxana reacts to this.

 Geordi, Data and Wesley are working at a console near the large wall schematic of the Enterprise.
 Troi has returned and is again wearing her clothes. In b.g., Nibor is playing 3-D chess with an N.D. Ferengi crewman.
 The lighting has been changed. It's softer now. Tog and Lwaxana are alone. he has just poured something liquid into a glass for her. She is wearing a sexy gown, and feeling rather seductive. They are sitting close together on the edge of the bed.
 Riker's in b.g., looking at Nibor and the chessboard on the other side of the archway. CLOSE on Troi -- reacting to what's coming across her telepathic link to Lwaxana...
 In the Gamma Erandi Nebula, a gaseous interstellar cloud aglow with brilliant light reflected back from its ionized particles. Within are nests of hundreds of embryonic stars, dense globules of nuclear fusion pouring forth light and heat, on the most massive scale imaginable.

 Wesley is deciding which personal items to take with him. As he surveys his possessions, he will discard some and place others in a "keep" pile. DOOR CHIME.
 Riker and Troi are still in the cell; Nibor smugly makes a move on the chessboard.

 GEORDI and WORF are at the bar. Geordi discreetly indicates a young woman sitting with a friend (it is CHRISTY, whom we last saw in "Booby Trap" telling Geordi that she wasn't interested in him "that way").
 RIKER, BEVERLY, and DATA are moving rapidly down the corridor towards the Transporter Room. A Turbolift OPENS and Geordi ENTERS. He quickly falls in step with the others.
 The Away Team MATERIALIZES in front of the shattered hull of the wrecked escape pod.
 Patient "John Doe" has just been placed in a special emergency surgical bed. Electrodes are feverishly being attached to his head and chest. Beverly, NURSE TEMPLE, and SEVERAL MEDICAL CREWPERSONS are working on John.
 PICARD, Riker, Data, and Worf are on the Bridge.

 Two hours later. Doctor Crusher has successfully reattached her patient's arm and high-tech bandages now cover the wound. Beverly looks fatigued. Temple is monitoring some equipment.
 Geordi, Worf, and Data are seated at one of the tables. Geordi and Data are deep in conversation, while Worf looks a little bored. Geordi is holding the storage capsule.
 His attitude and demeanor are in marked contrast to the first scene with Christy in the Teaser. A smile breaks out on his face and he confidently gets up from the table and starts to head for the bar.

 We see that the patient has been removed from the emergency surgical bed and is now lying on an ordinary sickbay bed.

 FADE IN:
 Cruising on impulse power.
 The room has several devices designed for physical rehabilitation scattered around it. The circular disc that hangs over the operating table in Sickbay now hangs here and dominates the room. There are a few subtle changes in the disc to suggest small devices and sensors. John is reclining in a chair beneath the disc. Small BEAMS OF LIGHT lance down from the disc and move along John's limbs. Beverly is standing at a nearby console monitoring the therapy. John's attitude is bright, positive. He is vibrant and full of confidence as he goes through his rehabilitation.
 Beverly works the console and the beams STOP. She picks up some medical bands about the size and shape of dog collars and begins to attach them to John's arms and legs.
 As Picard ENTERS. Picard, who has met John before, realizes that he is witnessing a key moment in John's recuperation and watches without interrupting. John begins to walk a little too fast once more and loses his balance near Picard, who quickly catches him before he falls. Picard helps John to regain his balance and then lets him go.
 Riker waiting for Turbolift. The doors open and reveal Geordi and Christy kissing inside. Christy pulls away and smiles at Geordi.
 John is sitting on the operating table with bands on his arms and legs. Beverly is working at a console while John practices flexing and stretching his muscles. The door to Sickbay OPENS and O'BRIEN ENTERS wearing a kayaking outfit. He is holding his shoulder and has a rueful expression on his face.
 John looks at O'Brien... sees his discomfort... a look of gentle compassion comes over his features. John goes over to O'Brien and puts his hand on his injured shoulder just as Beverly ENTERS from the lab in the b.g.
 Cruising along.
 Wesley at the table. He and Beverly have just finished dinner. Beverly is returning to the table with a couple of drinks. She sets the drinks down and then sits.
 Data is working at the aft science station as Geordi ENTERS the Bridge from the aft Turbolift. He carries the storage capsule in his hand.
 John is shocked.
 as he reaches for the cup. He doubles over in more intense pain that we saw earlier... the spasm lasts longer this time. With great effort, he tries to release the pain by sheer will. The pain subsides after a final spasm and a BRIGHT YELLOWISH GLOW moves quickly from his chest to along his arms and then disappears. Hold on John... bewildered and frightened.
 Beverly and John ENTER. The room is filled with SUPERNUMERARIES... a busy, lively atmosphere. John and Beverly pause near the bar.
 Data and Worf at their stations, Picard and Riker at Command.
 John is reading about Federation history on a computer terminal. Suddenly a spasm of pain shoots through his body, doubling him over in agony.
 The screen is monitoring the lifesigns of John, when a RED WARNING LIGHT comes on along with a BEEPING SOUND.
 The doors open and Nurse Temple ENTERS. She goes over to John, who is clearly in torment.
 Moving with Beverly as she follows John. He goes into the corridor and Beverly stops in the doorway. She hesitates for a moment. She doesn't want to do anything to hurt John, but realizes her duty to the ship outweighs her personal feelings. She hits her combadge.
 Looking down into the shuttle bay. TWO SHUTTLE TECHNICIANS are working on a shuttlecraft along with Geordi. He steps back from the shuttle.

 He looks down and sees Worf... a horrified expression on his face.

 Beverly looks at John with awe. He smiles... and for that moment he is serene and at peace with himself. All eyes on John as he helps Worf to his feet. On their reactions...
 Travelling at impulse.
 Picard, Beverly, and John. Picard at his desk, his expression grim. Beverly watches with concern and compassion.
 Picard emerges from the Ready Room, followed by Beverly and John. As Picard goes to his chair, Geordi approaches John still near the door to the Ready Room. Geordi hesitates before speaking -- a hesitation born from admiration and wonder, not fear.
 as Picard takes his seat, looks at the Main Viewer. On it is an alien spaceship -- very sleek, very military.
 as Picard notices John's cold, hard-edged expression; it's the expression John gets when thinking of his past. Picard gives John a look -- "do you recognize that ship? John shrugs helplessly -- he doesn't know.
 The image of the approaching ship is replaced with SUNAD, an imposing Zalkonian humanoid physiologically similar to John but whose attire and demeanor is much more military, more aggressive, almost Draconian.

 A quick glance tells John that his efforts to save the crew have been successful. He moves to the center of the Bridge, faces the Main Viewer with an air of quiet command. On the Viewer, Sunad reacts -- the calm self assurance in John's manner frightens him, but he acts tough in a vain attempt to hide his terror. He barks orders to someone o.s.:

 John takes a step toward Sunad, who backs up.

 The Captain's vital signs are stable...
 looking at an Okudagram...
 First neural connection is confirmed... I cannot report any significant access to the Borg consciousness...
 moving by Mars... unmanned pods attack it... the Borg ship destroys them easily... moves on... and now we reveal their final destination... the familiar shape of Earth straight ahead...
 It is confirmed... the Borg have broken through the Mars defense perimeter...

 Second neural connection is confirmed... I still cannot report any significant access... proceeding with the final link...

 grabs the Borg hand and holds it back from the controls using his extraordinary strength...
 locked in a symbolic arm wrestle for control of Picard... and finally after straining at both ends, Data wins by breaking the arm off at the wrist joint...
 Data, I'm picking up increased neural activity in Captain Picard... localized in the prefrontal and parietal lobes...

 from Data... Beverly... O'Brien...
 Troi to Bridge. Data has made first contact with Captain Picard...
 Sir, it is clear the Borg are unable or unwilling to terminate their subspace links...
 to see the Borg ship long range... Earth in the background.
 Attempting to reroute subcommand paths, Captain... defense systems are protected by access barriers...
 and the Borg squaring off one last time with Earth as the backdrop... the Borg ship sends out their tractor beam...
 The ship shakes...
 Shaking continuing...
 shaking with the ship... stirring...
 Picard groans, whispers...
 Borg cutting beam activated...
 The Borg cutting beam reaches out to the Enterprise...
 Crack of impact... a dreadful shake...
 Suddenly, the attack simply ends.
 Reactions.
 I successfully planted a command in the Borg collective consciousness, sir. It misdirected them to believe it was time to regenerate. In effect, I put them all to sleep.
 Reactions.
 Shelby, Worf and Gleason MATERIALIZE... They examine the Borg... who are all in their compartments...
 Riker on the move...
 Checking...
 Riker has just entered... Beverly has heard. Data is still tied up with Picard...
 The Enterprise moves away and... the Borg ship explodes... in several decentralized small bursts.
 Picard shudders...
 Orbiting Earth.
 Picard has had his surgery... his face is half-bandaged... he is back in uniform. With him is Riker, still wearing his Captain's pips.
 The ship approaches a small Talarian vessel, adrift.
 To include MAIN VIEWER. PICARD, TROI, and RIKER in the Command Chairs. DATA at Ops, WORF at Tactical, WESLEY at Conn.
 Gaseous, dark, flickering neon lights accent the area as Riker, Worf and BEVERLY MATERIALIZE with TWO MEDICAL SUPERNUMERARIES carrying equipment. Riker, tricorder in hand, steps forward, wary and alert. They move into the interior of the ship, scanning constantly with his tricorder, the others following.
 revealing FIVE TALARIANS, some with radiation burns, most too weak to stand. They wear a helmet-like head covering that is decidedly war-like in appearance, and all wear gloves.
 One critical-status Talarian is being treated for radiation damage. Other survivors are whisked into the ward by MEDICAL SUPERNUMERARIES.
 Picard and Riker ENTER; Beverly approaches them.
 Picard ENTERS with Beverly.
 He is thrashing on the bed, resisting the efforts of two medical SUPERNUMERARIES and Troi to restrain him. Then, he bursts into that dreadful shriek. The other Talarians follow suit.
 as they rush from the office.
 Worf and Jono ENTER.
 Picard, Riker, Beverly, Troi and Data.
 Jono sits cross-legged, his high-pitched wail now having achieved a ritualistic, mournful rhythm. He keeps at it, indefatigably, then suddenly breaks off as he sees --
 who stands at the door, observing him.
 The door opens and Picard and Jono ENTER.
 Picard sits, musing, distressed. The SOUND OF A CHIME.
 Picard approaches his quarters, carrying a portable visual monitor; as he does, he hears the muffled sound of noise from within: a maelstrom of electronic sound, discordant and unstructured. Puzzled, he opens his door. The sound blasts forth, deafening.
 The volume of the noise is truly frightening. Picard looks around his room, noting that the furniture has been completely re-arranged.
 The photographs of the Rossa family on Galen IV -- including the infant and child Jeremiah, seen earlier in the Observation Lounge.
 to include MAIN VIEWER. Data, Worf, and Wesley are at stations. Picard ENTERS, sits.
 Both ships hold positions facing one another.
 Endar and TWO TALARIAN MILITIA MATERIALIZE, and greet Riker and Worf.
 Picard with Endar.
 Jono still sits in front of the monitor, flipping through the various photographs, over and over. Troi is with him.
 Moira Rossa holds her infant son, who snuggles securely at her breast. His tiny fingers are clasped around one of her fingers, and she is smiling at him with unashamed adoration. His baby smile returns that unqualified love.
 tears his eyes from the screen, agitated and disturbed.
 Picard is with Beverly and Troi.
 Troi sits with Endar; they look up as the doors slide open. Picard ENTERS with Jono, who spots his "father" and rushes forward.
 silently observing this moment of alien affection. They withdraw to a corner of the room so as not to intrude. They cannot hear Endar and Jono clearly.
 They separate, Endar finding it difficult to hide concern. They sit, and speak in hushed voices, huddled together.
 Picard, with Riker, Troi, Beverly, Worf and Data.
 Picard sits with Jono as they view the visual monitor. Addressing them is CONNAUGHT ROSSA, a woman in her
 Picard is with Jono, giving him basic instruction in the game. It has changed over the centuries in about the way that tennis, say, changed from Henry VIII's day to the present. The basic principles are the same; the racquet is different -- sleeker, more streamlined wall, there is an ELECTRONIC SOUND -- something that will begin to sound not unlike a phaser.
 as Picard and Jono ENTER into a rousing and surprisingly close game. Jono has natural ability and the resilience of youth, and gives Picard a run for it. The electronic ZAP of the ball as it ricochets around the court becomes louder and louder, and gradually its presence changes, sounding more and more like a weapon.
 reacts to this, shaking his head as though to clear it.
 as the sounds begin to fade. Picard kneels with him, puts his arm around the shaking boy's shoulders. Jono looks up at him, his face wet with tears.
 Jono sits talking with Picard. They are still in racquetball clothes. Jono is subdued, but talks freely.
 Well, how was racquetball?
 has a spattering of whipped cream on his face and chest.
 Jono stares at him, at first shocked at what he has done.
 as they move off to the side, Jono, Wesley, and Data remain at the table.
 The rooms are darkened, but we can see Jono, resting in his ceiling hammock. His eyes are open. He stares into the darkness for a few beats, and then he lifts up, descends from the ceiling.
 Picard is asleep. Jono ENTERS, approaches Picard like a thief in the night. He gazes down at the sleeping Captain, struggling with his emotions.
 Picard is groggy, but recognizing Jono, gives him a smile. Jono returns the smile -- then loses the smile to a terror within.
 Picard is on a bed with Beverly scanning him. Picard is unconscious and pale.
 as he stirs, eyes fluttering open and sees Beverly, who has the autosuture and is using it on him. Picard looks around as though coming out of a fog, trying to get his bearings.
 Riker in command, Worf at Tactical, Data at Ops, Wesley on the Conn.
 The main viewer now shows the Q'Maire; two other warships are behind it, moving toward the Enterprise.
 La Forge here, sir.
 Commander, Captain of the Q'Maire requests communication.
 Two SECURITY MEN escort Jono into Picard's Sickbay cubicle. The boy stands before Picard, taut as a wire, staring straight ahead.
 Things are very tense.
 Endar appears.

 Supernumerary at the controls. Picard motions Jono toward the transporter platform.
 eyes on the empty pad, sure the right thing has been done.
 Picard ENTERS, finds the room still disheveled, his furniture still disarranged. He looks up, sees the hammock dangling from the ceiling. He smiles, remembering the antic child, but then feels a chill, realizing how empty the room now seems. He reaches up, plucks the hammock from its hooks, and cradles it in his hands. He knows he has been given something by knowing this boy. He begins to put his room back to its former orderliness.
 traveling at warp speed.
 A turbolift door opens and TROI and a trembling twelve- year-old boy, JAKE POTTS, emerge and head down the corridor.
 RIKER is standing alone at the window (with the ship travelling at Warp speed) as Troi and Jake ENTER. Troi motions Jake to sit.
 Moving downward. Data and Jake.
 PICARD, WORF, and WESLEY. SUPERNUMERARY at Ops. FOLLOW Riker and Troi, as they ENTER from the Observation Lounge and cross to the Command Center. DATA descends the ramp toward Ops.
 We've completed our dilithium vector calibrations, sir. You're clear to increase to warp seven.
 Very good, Geordi. Let me know if you...
 Geordi, ENSIGN KOPF and TWO SUPERNUMERARIES are at the pool table.
 Data is at Science One busy at work.
 Picard, Geordi, Wesley, Ensign Kopf, and supernumerary, as before.
 Data, still at Science One, is reading something on the console.
 As before -- a series of beeps from Geordi's panel.
 Worf and a SECURITY OFFICER have opened a large ceiling panel. Riker climbs into it.
 Data is seated in Picard's chair working his console when he hears a series of high-pitched beeps. He crosses to his Ops panel, sits, and presses a quick series of commands.
 The ceiling panel is open. No one is visible in the tube itself. A bright flash appears from the opening above.
 Picard, Geordi, Wesley, Kopf, and supernumeraries. Picard is pacing near the pool table.
 Beverly watches Willie in the background.
 It seems, Doctor, that Mister Data has other plans for the Enterprise right now.
 is traveling at warp speed.
 Beverly passes her hands through two holes in the glass wall. We see a brief blue flicker as her hands break through the invisible quarantine field. She gently holds WILLIE POTTS' head, examining him.
 The Enterprise comes out of warp and enters orbit of Soong's planet.
 Data is again seated at Science One, punching in coordinates.
 Picard exits Geordi's office and strides out toward the pool table where Riker, Geordi, Wesley and Worf are working.
 O'Brien is studying a panel.
 I want security teams along the main passageways and in every transporter oom, Lieutenant. See if the computer would be good enough to give you the specific stun setting to disable Mister Data.
 Data at Science One.
 Geordi, Wesley, Riker and Picard as before.
 The Turbolift doors open as Data ENTERS, turns left and heads down the corridor. A SECURITY TEAM runs toward him from behind, but is stopped by a force field which appears across the corridor in front of them.
 A new force field appears in front and behind Data as before.
 Data, now alone, walks to the entrance of the Transporter Room.
 The doors hiss open and Data ENTERS to find Riker, O'Brien and a N.D. SECURITY guard standing on the transporter pad, phasers raised.
 Data with the same glazed look trudges through a misty forest into a clearing where a small structure can be seen.
 A cluttered, dark room filled with an odd mix of high tech equipment and everyday necessities. At one end is an elaborate panorama filled with dozens of model dinosaurs.
 (A note about Soong: like many of history's greatest minds, Noonian Soong is usually pre-occupied and often self-indulgent. He has few social graces and is rather inarticulate when discussing anything other than cybernetics. Behavior which could easily be attributed to an insensitive or arrogant nature is nothing more than a mixture of scatterbrained genius and playful whimsy.)
 The Enterprise in orbit of Soong's planet.
 Picard, Geordi, Riker and Wesley...
 CLOSE on a NURSE'S hand holding a hypospray as it passes through the quarantine field openings, causing the brief blue flicker. PULL BACK to see her deliver the injection into Willie's neck. Beverly ENTERS and sits in the chair the nurse has vacated. Willie doesn't look well.
 The Bridge is empty. After a beat, the turbolift doors open and a cautious Worf with two N.D. security guards ENTER, phasers drawn. After a quick look --
 Picard, Riker, and Geordi. The turbolift is moving upward.
 The turbolift doors open and Picard and Riker cross to Worf. Geordi goes to his aft station.
 CLOSE ON Data's face. One hand is patting his head rhythmically. PULL BACK to reveal his other hand, palm open, making circular movements on his stomach. Soong sits opposite, entranced.
 Lore is now seated in the same "dentist" chair in which we found Data earlier. Soong is standing over him, arranging some tools. Data stands beside Soong.
 in around Soong's planet.
 Picard, Riker, Beverly, Troi, Geordi and Worf.
 Soong is repositioning his model dinosaurs as Lore paces behind him, still visibly upset. Data is seated.
 in orbit of Soong's planet.
 Picard and Riker are walking at a brisk pace.
 The Transporter doors open as Picard and Riker ENTER, continuing their conversation. Worf and Geordi are already on the pad. O'Brien is behind his console.
 Lore is seated in the "dentist" chair, as before. He appears unconscious. Rather than working in his mouth, Soong is busy inside an open flap on Lore's neck. Finally, he runs a scanner over the area and carefully closes the flap. Soong reaches behind Lore and manipulates the on/off switch hidden in his back. Lore opens his eyes and looks around.
 The Away Team is walking through the same misty forest we saw earlier.
 Soong is still spread out on the smashed panorama. He has begun to stir. The door bursts open and Worf ENTERS, phaser raised. He scans the room as Riker and Geordi follow him in. Riker runs to the semi-conscious Soong and motions Worf to check out the rest of the dwelling.
 The Enterprise is docked at Starbase Four-One-Six.
 Picard and Beverly walk through the corridor on their way to the quarantine area.
 As Picard and Beverly ENTER the quarantine area, they find Data watching Jake and Willie at a distance. Jake sits at the window with his hands through the openings. The brothers are playing with two model dinosaurs. They argue for a moment, but then smile. Picard and Beverly approach Data.
 The Spacedock in orbit around Earth. As Picard records his log, there is a subtle hint of finality in his voice and tone... a feeling that he's wrapping things up here.
 Revealing the Enterprise being worked on at the dock.
 RIKER is looking over a lot of reports and padds on the desk. The door CHIMES.
 PICARD, in civilian clothes, is putting a few belongings into a small rucksack.
 The Enterprise still docked.
 O'BRIEN is working on the console as Worf ENTERS.
 sees them... and in this moment of reunion, there is nothing short of love in his face. Even he cannot suppress it... and there is even, god forbid, a smile that grows on his face.
 Picard walking up a dirt path, carrying the rucksack seen earlier as he passes by a vineyard. He is looking around, drinking in the sights, sounds, and smells of his home. He reacts as he hears movement in the adjoining field... he stops, looks... the sound stops too... he starts up again and the movement follows him. He cocks an eyebrow moves to the field...
 The house sits adjacent to a small vineyard. The house itself is made of stone and wood, and there is a noticeable lack of 24th-century design or devices in the building and its surroundings. There is an aged historical plaque on the side of the house. The setting is rural, and looks much like a farmhouse in the French countryside would have looked in the 19th century. Rene runs down the path, ahead of Picard...
 ROBERT is between two rows of grapevines, on his hands and knees. He is about six to eight years older than Picard, and manages to appear dignified even as he scrabbles about in the dirt working on the vines with his hands. We can see that he devotes the same careful attention to detail in his work as his brother does on the bridge of his ship. Picard walks down the row and stops in front of him. Robert looks up and sees Picard, but remains on his knees. There is no animosity on his face, but no welcome either, just recognition.
 In the f.g. are fields of vineyards, punctuated by small farmhouses that reflect the architecture and design of the 19th century rather than that of the 24th century. On the horizon is the actual village of Labarre, a city whose roots stretch back for over a millennium. There is a feeling of old and new living side by side... the village itself is quite modern. On Picard and Robert as the distance between them grows...
 BEVERLY is getting a couple of drinks from the food replicator. Troi is sitting on the couch.
 Several panels are open, some boxes sitting around... this is a ship undergoing a major refit and it's a bit of a mess right now. Worf stands uncomfortably as his father tells a story to an enthralled Geordi...
 Sergey has noticed that Worf & Helena have left.
 Lights are on inside the house.
 The interior of the home should reflect the same preference for an earlier time and way of life as does the exterior. A single computer terminal is in evidence, along with one or two other hi-tech devices, but they should accent the fact that the house is a warm French country home from the early 19th century and just happens to exist in the 24th century. The small dining area is adjacent to the living room and there are doors to suggest other rooms. The dinner table has been set for a meal of onion soup, baguette, and wine. Picard, Robert, Marie, and Rene are just sitting down. The tone is deceptively cordial.
 The town as seen before.
 Picard and LOUIS are walking along the vineyard. Louis is a large, gregarious man about Picard's age and should be very outgoing with a zest for life. Looking over the fields --
 Fewer people around than normal, a feeling of being somewhere after normal hours. Worf, Sergey and Helena are sitting down at a table.
 to reveal Guinan. They look over and smile, hello.
 Picard is sitting at the table, lost in thought. The lights are low. The table monitor is on with some Okudagrams that Louis sent over about the underwater project. He is staring through rather than at it. Marie ENTERS carrying some jars and glasses.
 PULL BACK as Picard stands alone on the empty grounds... a lost man. On his expression...
 FADE IN:
 WESLEY and Beverly sitting together. Beverly is keyed- up and trying not to let her feelings show too strongly. Beverly holds the disk in her hand, gripping it tightly. She is positive, trying to be cheerful, but there is an undertone of worry in her voice. Wesley is excited.
 Worf's sash is sitting on a chair. He is looking in a mirror and examining the length of his hair. The door CHIMES.
 Picard is sitting at the table, drinking wine... he is as distressed as we've ever seen him... indeed, if this has been a trip to "find himself" as Troi suggested, then "he" seems only farther away than when the trip started...
 standing at the door, silhouetted by the light of fading day outside... studying his brother. He moves closer... as Picard pours himself some more wine from the half-empty bottle...
 Robert trails Picard... Picard tries to control himself throughout the scene... Robert continues to dig at him...
 Robert pulls himself out of the brush and grabs Picard and Picard grabs him and an awkward dance between two middle-aged men acting like children ensues... and slowly we may come to realize there's a slightly humorous edge to this. Robert pulls him to the wet ground and they roll over and over in the mud and as they make one final roll, they realize they're laughing... and the laughter consumes them as they lie side-by-side on the ground, as dirty as little kids, looking up at the sky.
 Marie enters the front door... reacts at what she sees
 to see Picard and Robert still covered with mud, eating cheese and fruit at the table... they look up like children caught with their hands in the cookie jar...
 Near the Holodeck doors. Wes steps back, stands in front of the doors. His expression is excited, expectant... but there is a trace of apprehension here too. He hesitates long enough for us to realize that this is a big moment in his life. He clears his throat, then in an artificially calm and steady voice...
 Dark except for a brightly lit circle in the center of the room. Sitting on a chair in a limited set inside this circle of light is the frozen image of Jack Crusher. Not the towering figure of legend that Wesley (and we) expect to meet... Jack is of medium build, about Wesley's height, finely boned, and perhaps most shocking is that fact that Jack is about 24 years of age. He wears an older Starfleet uniform with lieutenant's insignia. His expression and attitude are cheerful, confident... a man with his entire future ahead of him.
 Wesley studies him... this is not what he expected. Jack doesn't look much older than he does. The man who was his father is more like a peer than a parent. Wesley expected to be awed by what he remembered only as a very big man who played with him as a child. As Jack speaks, Wesley tries not only to pay attention to what is being said, but also to try and get a feeling for who he was and what kind of man he might have been.
 Wesley hesitates... then moves toward his father, but just as reaches out... Jack FADES AWAY. Wesley stands alone in the darkness.
 The town as seen before.
 Picard, Robert, Marie, Rene standing outside. Picard is now in uniform, carrying the rucksack. Robert has a small package. Marie gives Picard a hug.
 Worf, Sergey, and Helena walking to transporter room. Worf is less stiff with them, more of a family feeling here at last.
 Marie and Robert look out the window.
 Rene is lying on his back in the vineyard, looking up at the night sky.

 BEVERLY stands waiting patiently. O'BRIEN is at the console. A quite elderly man in a Starfleet uniform MATERIALIZES on the Transporter pad: DALEN QUAICE. He carries a small bag. As he steps slowly off the pad, Beverly moves to embrace him.
 As Beverly and Quaice walk along.
 WESLEY is immersed in work at a computer as GEORDI and a couple of SUPERNUMERARIES make final preparations for departure.
 Right! Okay!
 Beverly has gone.
 Clear all moorings. Engineering, aft thrusters.

 Beverly steps off a turbolift, heads for the door to some guest quarters, activates the door chimes. There is no acknowledgement. She tries again, then causes the door to open.
 Beverly ENTERS, looks around the room. Nothing looks disturbed.
 FADE IN:
 Beverly is waiting when the door opens. WORF ENTERS.
 PICARD is seated at his desk. Facing him are DATA, Worf and Beverly.
 Wesley is at the helm. Riker nods as Beverly and Picard emerge from the Ready Room.

 A middle-aged woman, CARA HILL, frowns at Beverly.
 Picard listens as Beverly explains.
 Wesley and Geordi are at a computer.
 As Beverly and Picard ENTER from the Ready Room, Riker is in his chair, Data at Ops, Worf at Tactical. On the move...
 Wesley and Geordi are at a computer. PULL BACK to find Beverly and Picard behind them.
 It is a very distinctive, twisting shape... unique enough to be recognized later.
 There was a momentary flash of light. It was all over the spectrum.
 Beverly ENTERS. Sickbay is totally deserted. She stands frozen in the middle of the room, fighting off a rising panic. She turns and hurries out.
 Beverly ENTERS from the turbolift. Data is at Ops, Picard and Riker looking over his shoulder. Worf is at Tactical, a SUPERNUMERARY at Conn. There are no other crew members present.
 As they enter, sit. Picard takes a long beat. The tone is low-key...
 Beverly ENTERS. We TRACK with her. Suddenly she stops dead, her eyes trying to focus on something she sees before her.
 Something is forming in the air: a swirling vortex of color and sound, spiraling larger, the sound a roar of white noise, growing in intensity.
 As the vortex grows, its wind begins to buffet her. She finds herself being drawn by its force. She braces herself against the wall. But the pull grows stronger and stronger. Before she knows it she's caught up in a whirling, blinding maelstrom. She grabs on to something as she finds herself being inexorably pulled into the vortex... Beverly screams.
 I've had a team in Sickbay for two hours. We've run the mass spectrometer on all particulates... we've scanned the EM spectrum in case a wave guide was somehow leaking radiation... we've even crawled into the life support ductwork... Captain, I don't know what this vortex was that Doctor Crusher saw...
 Troi moves down the hall. Beverly, trying to contain her frustration, hurries after her...
 Only one supernumerary is working when Beverly rushes in. She goes to the computer station he was working at before. The same distinctive Okudagram is on the monitors, graphically illustrating the warp field bubble. But Wesley's not there. Red Alert continues.
 When Beverly comes around the corner, Wesley is gone. No optical. No sound effect. Just: no Wesley.

 Red Alert continues. Picard is in his chair. When Beverly gets off the turbolift, she sees there's no one else with Picard.
 Picard goes to Beverly, touches her gently on the arm.
 the vortex forming again in front of the viewscreen. She begins to feel herself being dragged towards it. She grabs on to Tactical, holds on for dear life, as the vortex tries to claim her. It pulls her horizontal to the floor. But she is successfully fighting it. As her struggle continues, the camera pans across the vortex, as it begins to collapse. It fills the screen and
 The pan continuing. The screaming heart of the maelstrom. Another place can be discerned in the distance. A VOICE becoming more distinct.
 We are on the other side of the vortex. Wesley and Geordi sit at computers, rapidly executing commands. No Red Alert. The vortex is swiftly contracting.
 The Traveler phases in.
 Moving at impulse speed against a backdrop of stars.
 Picard, Riker, Wesley, Geordi, Troi, Worf and the Traveler. He is friendly and wants to be helpful, at the same time he is a clearly superior being and is a bit smug in this knowledge.
 Red Alert continuing. Beverly walks slowly everywhere, examining everything, looking for something out of place, any clue that might help her... she's been doing a lot of thinking... takes a deep breath... (and there's a thread of gallows humor in all this for her now)...
 Opening doors as she walks down the deserted hallway... glancing inside...
 Red Alert continuing. As she ENTERS from the turbolift...
 At impulse.
 Wes and the Traveler moving to the pool table. Geordi works in the b.g. Wesley is very task-oriented here... the Traveler patient, calm...
 Beverly is at Tactical. Red Alert still on.

 Picard, Riker, Data, Worf.
 Geordi at a console... A couple of SUPERNUMERARIES work in the b.g.
 FADE IN: Beverly paces, trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together, moves to a Science Station.
 Computer, give me a graphic representation of the universe.
 Picard, Riker, Troi, Worf and Data.
 Geordi examining the bubble on a monitor...
 Riker glances at Picard who nods, begins to move toward the Turbolift...
 As before the Traveler and Wesley punch equations into their computers. The Traveler never watches the computer, only Wesley... Wesley is concentrating, trying too hard...
 The Red Alert continues. Beverly is pacing, stops to stare at the diagram again as the ship shakes, then resumes pacing.
 No Red Alert. Picard ENTERS. Geordi and supernumeraries are nearby. Wesley's relaxing into the task... still entering equations with his eyes closed. The Traveler, satisfied, closes his eyes... after a beat, he begins to phase...
 Two minutes thirty seconds to life support failure.
 Close on Wesley... as he goes deeper and deeper inside himself... using his extraordinary mental abilities, trying to reach out for his mother...
 Red Alert continuing.
 Beverly waits. Suddenly the turbolift jars to a halt.
 No Red Alert. The Traveler is still phasing. His eyes and Wesley's eyes are still closed. And then, incredibly, Wesley begins to phase too... In the background, the vortex begin to form. Reactions.
 Beverly steps off the turbolift. It vanishes behind her, revealing the gray, misty void. She sees it, takes off at a run. As she runs, pieces of the ship disappear behind her. She's only keeping a few steps ahead of it!
 Picard and Geordi watch as Welsey's phasing begins to sync up with the Traveler. The vortex grows even brighter. But then Geordi glances at his readouts, shakes his head, looks at Picard, quietly --
 Red Alert. Beverly charges in. The vortex is there, but beginning to break up! She leaps through!
 Beverly half falls, half tumbles out of the vortex. The vortex vanishes in a flash of light. Picard moves to her. Wesley and the Traveler stop phasing. Wesley collapses, exhausted. And the Traveler, too, looks drained. Picard helps Beverly to her feet. He smiles, embraces her.

 Flashing at warp speed across a field of stars.
 Data at his instruments.
 Picard glances at the Conn.
 A field of stars and a reddish planet, Turkana Four. We're close enough to barely make out in the far distance, a ship in orbit around the planet. As we watch, the ship explodes in what from this distance, looks like a delicate, silent, flash of color.

 A spare, meeting ground area, with a few crates serving as objects to sit on or lean against -- a very casual guerrilla look.
 Picard is examining the bottle from the colony; the away team is back and standing nearby. Bridge crew consists of Riker, Data, Worf, Beverly, Troi, and a supernumerary at the Conn.
 A close shot of Hayne in the same location. A young woman, ISHARA, is standing next to and slightly behind him. She is early to mid-twenties, blonde, slender, athletic and attractive.
 Riker glances at Picard, then toward the viewscreen.
 Hayne nods acknowledgement -- as one equal to another.
 The crew is staring at the viewscreen.
 Hayne and Ishara looking at the crew.
 As Picard turns to his officers.
 Hayne and Ishara.
 CLOSE ON Ishara, MATERIALIZING on the transporter pad.
 Data and Ishara are walking away from the transporter room.
 The door slides open and Data ENTERS with Ishara.
 Waiting in the room. Picard, Riker, Troi, Geordi, Beverly. They can't help but stare at her for a couple of silent beats -- almost as if looking for some sign of Tasha.
 Ishara reacts to their gaze.
 TAN TSU, one of the missing crewmen, is facing the viewer. He looks a bit bruised and battered from the crash.
 Take that threat seriously, Captain. They'll torture them and then they'll kill them. My cadre has never recovered a hostage alive from the Alliance.
 Access tunnels are here...
 Riker, Data, Geordi, Worf and Ishara gathered around a large flat screen, as Ishara indicates various locations. She seems much more comfortable now that they are deep in "work" mode.
 Ishara is sitting on a diagnostic bed as Beverly slowly brushes an instrument over the inside of the young woman's arm. (NOTE: The instrument does touch the skin) Data is standing nearby.
 A half-fallen down tunnel area similar to what the away team saw earlier. A slender, three-meter-long, heavily- damaged escape pod is in the center of the area, guarded by TWO ALLIANCE MEN AND ONE ALLIANCE WOMAN, mid-twenties, armed with one phaser and two stunsticks.

 The Alliance guards at the pod appear dumbfounded at the alarm wailing distantly offscreen. It is followed by a second. And a third.
 Alarms are blaring. Ishara moves around a projection, phaser at ready.
 as he works beneath the pod. There is a sudden crackling noise.
 As Geordi looks up momentarily from the work.
 O'Brien is desperately working the controls.
 Standby! Stay here and cover La Forge.
 Ishara is creeping along behind a series of projections, the alarms blaring around her. She suddenly stops dead in her tracks, as her implant pulses orange/yellow. She whips around -- the guard has just stepped from behind a low wall. Ishara aims her phaser too late -- the guard swings his stunstick, which lets out a bright, crackling arc flash that hits Ishara across the ribcage, sending her flying across the floor, her phaser fire rainbowing across the air as she goes.
 As he starts to hurry across to Ishara -- and is suddenly fired upon by two men from behind a projection. Riker returns fire continuously, as a still dazed Ishara attempts to stand. He reaches her and hauls the barely conscious woman into the next tunnel -- touching his insignia with his free hand as he goes.
 O'Brien is working the controls. Data, Worf and Geordi are waiting expectantly.
 Riker and Ishara RE-MATERIALIZE, Ishara now completely limp in his arms.
 Picard is going over a technical report. The door chimes.
 Ishara is sitting on a diagnostic bed, as Beverly runs a rectangular device that looks vaguely like a medical version of a phaser over the side of Ishara's ribcage.
 Ishara, now wearing more Federation-style than cadre-style clothing, is working with Data at a computer screen. He is sitting in front of it, she is standing next to him, guiding the process over his shoulder.
 displaying the schematic map of the underground city we've seen before. Far more of the details are now filled in.
 Data indicates a curiously-shaped room next to a large chamber.
 Data touches a control, causing the map to display a series of small concentric circles over the spot, symbolically suggestive of a radiating power source.
 Ishara again points to the map.
 Geordi, Worf, Data, Riker, and Ishara are poring over the schematic map of the underground city.
 which shows the pyramid-shaped underground series of levels and chambers.
 So much for the transporter.
 Geordi's hand indicates a line starting from just outside the surface settlement and heading straight down through the ground to a chamber near the one he previously indicated.
 It would take me a few hours to adjust the phasers for drilling.
 Data and Ishara are at a table, next to a window showing the stars outside. An already-drained glass is in front of Ishara.
 Picard is standing with Data and Troi.
 Data has arrived moments ago to where Ishara has been working at the station. She looks incredibly pleased.
 Ishara is looking at the viewscreen.
 Hayne's image stares back at her.
 Ishara pauses before answering, trying to hide from him how surprisingly difficult it is for her to continue.
 In orbit above the colony at Turkana Four.
 Ishara is awake and healthy-looking, on her back on a diagnostic bed, as Beverly runs a last series of checks to see if her indications are all positive. Beverly watches the wall monitors.

 Worf and Ishara walking quickly along. Worf looks towards her with affection.
 Riker and Data are conferring with O'Brien as the door opens and Worf and Ishara ENTER.
 Picard is watching the planet on the viewscreen. Geordi is at his station, leaned over his instruments.
 The phasers fire in a single beam down towards the planet.
 Same MATTE SHOT as previously, with a phaser beam continuously striking perpendicular to the ground just outside the city proper.
 Picard watching Geordi as Geordi watches his instruments.
 The away team of Riker, Data, Worf and Ishara beams into an isolated tunnel in which there are a few scattered storage cannisters and containers. Ishara immediately takes the lead.
 The away team pauses at a confusing series of openings.
 as Ishara leads the away team through an opening, past a couple of turns, to a place where they can see a secure-looking door, and one Alliance man standing guard nearby.
 A nondescript chamber. Riker, Data and Worf find Tan Tsu and the other crewman on their feet, hands bound together with some high-tech looking restraints.
 Ishara glances back towards the chamber, then immediately and with intent, heads away from the room, clearly pursuing her own agenda.
 Riker frees the last crewman as all react to the sudden alarm.
 The away team and crewmen come flying out of the room
 One Alliance guard is standing outside what looks like a room-sized power generator. He appears edgy about the distant alarm. Ishara steps from around a projection, phaser raised. The guard has a second to register complete surprise at her presence before she blasts him away.
 standing several yards away. He lowers his phaser, puzzled at her actions.
 Ishara's phaser is trained on Data; Ishara is positioned between Data and the increasingly overloading generator.
 Stepping from behind a projection, phaser raised. Ishara immediately fires at Riker, missing as he ducks back behind the projection, giving Data the split second he needs to raise his phaser and fire at her.
 In orbit around Turkana Four.
 A security man is standing guard outside crew's quarters. Worf approaches, stands in front of the door sitting inside the room, like a prisoner awaiting her fate.
 who seems barely able to tolerate her presence.
 The turbolift opens. Worf and Ishara step out and cross towards the center of the bridge, where Picard is facing the viewscreen. There is a vast coolness towards her from everyone -- in extreme contrast to the last time we saw them all together.
 A clearly-disappointed but not the least bit apologetic Hayne is facing them. Any sense of his disarming personality is gone.
 Data and Ishara are walking, not looking at each other.
 Data and Ishara are standing in front of the transporter units.

 Riker is working on a report.
 The door closes behind him as Data takes few steps then pauses.
 The ship moving at impulse power.
 PICARD, RIKER, DATA, WESLEY, and WORF at their stations.
 The attack cruiser (bigger than a bird-of-prey) DECLOAKS.
 We are being hailed.
 K'EHLEYR, the striking half-human, half-Klingon woman appears on the screen. She wears an attractive tunic and is standing in front of a Klingon bulkhead. She is here on important business and it shows on her face.
 He is pleasantly surprised at the sight of K'Ehleyr... but then he seems to remember something disturbing, and he pulls himself back into his customary Klingon stoic pose.
 Ambassador K'Ehleyr... This is an unexpected pleasure.
 TRANSPORTER TECHNICIAN behind the console. Worf ENTERS.
 K'Ehleyr and a Klingon boy (ALEXANDER) MATERIALIZE. (The boy should look about five human years old). K'Ehleyr smiles, glancing from the boy to Worf. On Worf's stunned reaction...
 I hope he'll be all right. Alexander hasn't had much contact with other children.
 As they ENTER.
 Picard, Riker, Data, TROI, and Worf listening to K'Ehleyr.
 The ship hangs in space.
 A large cabin intended to house visiting admirals or dignitaries. There are a few nasty-looking weapons in plain view along with decorative banners and emblems of the Empire, denoting its current occupant's rank as head of the High Council. There are several chairs and tables. A flagon of wine sits on one table. A single set of doors is visible. The doors OPEN and Picard is escorted in by a Klingon sentry.
 K'MPEC moves out of a dark corner and steps into the light. He looks older, more frail than when we saw him before. His cloak hangs on him like the shawl of an old man rather than the cape of a warrior, but there is still a vestige of steel left in his eyes.
 Captain's log: supplemental. K'mpec, who ruled the Klingon Empire longer than anyone in history, is dead. We await the arrival of Duras and Gowron... rivals for the leadership of the High Council.
 There are SEVERAL CHILDREN playing, ages 5 to 10. Alexander is being taught how to play a game using large blocks and balls by three other kids. As he tries his hand at the game... but instead of following the rules, he just grabs all the blocks to the protest of the other kids. They try to stop him... Alexander bares his teeth, as if to challenge them all... just as Worf's HAND suddenly moves into frame and restrains him.
 Revealing Worf standing over Alexander and the other kids. Alexander looks up defiantly at Worf.
 Worf and Alexander are heading for K'Ehleyr's quarters. Alexander is very curious... trying to probe. Worf is resistant, doesn't want to establish a connection with the boy, but it's difficult to distance himself.
 K'Ehleyr is studying an Okudagram on a terminal. The door OPENS and Worf and Alexander ENTER. Alexander runs to his mother, gives her a quick hug. She looks at Worf with surprise.
 TWO KLINGON BIRDS-OF-PREY approach the Enterprise and the first Klingon ship.
 Picard, Data, Riker, and Wesley at their positions. SUPERNUMERARY at Tactical.
 DURAS appears, standing in front of a bulkhead. His impatience is obvious.
 As they ENTER.
 K'mpec's ship.
 K'mpec's body has been left sitting in his chair. There should be no feeling of this being a "wake" in the human sense of the word... K'mpec's corpse is accorded no reverence. Picard and K'Ehleyr stand at the head of the room. K'Ehleyr is holding a painstick.
 as the doors OPEN. GOWRON and TWO KLINGON RETAINERS ENTER. One of the retainers carries a painstik. Gowron looks hostile, impatient... not a likely ally for Picard. They barely glance at the corpse and move to the left of K'mpec's still form.
 That's Gowron.
 as Duras and TWO MORE RETAINERS ENTER. One of Duras' men also carries a painstik. Duras wears a cloak showing him to be a member of the Council. Duras and Gowron snarl with hate at the sight of each other. Their retainers tense and it looks like they might fight it out right here... the moment passes and Duras moves to the opposite side of the room from Gowron.
 K'ehleyr is standing near the window. Worf ENTERS. He is obviously concerned... moves to her. He almost comforts her... pulls himself back... tries to pretend he came here on official business.
 K'Ehleyr and Picard.
 Duras and Gowron are moving restlessly in the room... like caged animals. TWO N.D. SECURITY GUARDS are posted in the center and they watch the two men closely. Picard and K'Ehleyr ENTER.
 Worf is trying to interest Alexander in some of the Klingon artifacts in his room. Alexander is bored and his attention wanders. Worf is holding a small Klingon statue.
 revealing more of Worf's bedroom. Alexander is looking with keen interest at something on a bulkhead. MOVE TO REVEAL a mounted case with a weapon inside. It is semi-circular curved blade that branches to four points. It is about three feet wide. There is a terrible beauty about the blade. Worf sees that he can make a connection here.
 K'Ehleyr is sitting at the table, working on a padd. Gowron ENTERS.
 GEORDI and Data at the pool table. They are working on one of the consoles. Riker ENTERS and goes over to them.
 Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, K'Ehleyr, and Geordi.
 Worf ENTERS from Observation Lounge... K'Ehleyr has been waiting for him. They EXIT to turbolift together.
 Worf and K'Ehleyr ENTER.
 K'Ehleyr ENTERS, still upset over the scene with Worf. She takes a deep breath... settles herself and then sits down at the computer terminal.
 Picard sitting at the table with Duras. Gowron is standing at the far end of the room, reciting part of the ritual. The two security men continue to watch in the b.g.
 As Worf ENTERS. Duras and Gowron are on their feet instantly.
 K'Ehleyr reading information on the terminal, reacting to what she sees...
 Klingon information scrolls briefly on the terminal screen and then stops. A large Klingon word ("Denied") appears in the middle of the screen and blinks on and off.
 As before.
 One of Duras' lieutenants (GUARD #2) is leaning over the computer reading a message as Duras ENTERS. An Enterprise SECURITY OFFICER takes his position outside the door.
 Guard#2 ENTERS from Duras' quarters... walks swiftly by the security officer and down the hall... the officer reacts...
 Behind him, Duras slips out of his room and disappears down the opposite end of the corridor.
 K'Ehleyr is working at the terminal. The door CHIMES.
 Beverly escorts Riker into her office...
 Worf and Alexander moving toward K'Ehleyr's Quarters.
 Worf and Alexander ENTER the quarters... suddenly see K'Ehleyr lying on the floor. Worf quickly moves to her and can now see that she is lying in a small pool of blood.
 as she grabs Worf's arms with a last burst of strength and passion... their eyes lock... then she's gone.
 After a beat, a LOW RUMBLING GROWL begins in Worf's chest... finally explodes as his throws back his head and ROARS, not just for the ritual, but with rage and agony.
 The boy backs away from Worf and K'Ehleyr in a mixture of fear and shock... Worf moves to him... looks into his face.
 Beverly and a N.D. NURSE ENTER. They rush to K'Ehleyr. Worf and Alexander share a look...
 She's checking K'Ehleyr... there's no hope. She looks up...
 Worf moving quickly, determined... he removes his insignia and sash... then takes the bat'telh sword from the frame on the wall...
 K'Ehleyr's body is being taken out on a gurney by the nurse seen earlier and another MEDICAL TECHNICIAN. Beverly is standing with Picard and Riker... their faces are grim.
 The ship hangs in space.
 Similar to K'mpec's Quarters seen earlier. The same sense of a visiting dignitary aboard ship, but not as high a rank as K'mpec. The atmosphere is darker, more sinister. Duras, and TWO RETAINERS are huddled over a computer terminal. The doors OPEN... Worf, carrying the bat'telh, and a KLINGON GUARD ENTER. Duras looks up, shocked to see Worf.
 Riker, Data, and TWO N.D. SECURITY GUARDS moving quickly along the corridor. Riker's expression is deadly serious.
 A tremendous CLANG of metal as Worf's sword deflects Duras' weapon. This isn't as brutish as normal Klingon fights... they skillfully manipulate their weapons with a sense of grace and balance... two samurai stalking and probing the defenses of each other. Worf is focused, intent... and there is a feral quality to his expression, as if the veneer of civilization has been stripped away and only the warrior is left.
 The combat continues... flashes of metal, snarls of fury... the ferocity builds... their weapons become tightly locked together... Worf glares into Duras' face with hatred.
 as Riker, Data, and the Security Guards ENTER. They stop at the sight of Worf and Duras.
 Worf and Duras pay no attention to Riker's arrival. (NOTE: and it should not in any way appear that Riker's appearance acts as a diversion that affects the outcome of the fight.) Worf kicks Duras' legs out from under him.
 reacts at the bat'telh is driven deep into his chest... he gasps, shudders, then is gone.
 Worf stands over his fallen adversary... the bat'telh sticking out of Duras's chest.
 Eyes still filled with rage, stares at Duras.
 The ship hangs in space.

 Worf is speaking to Alexander on the couch.

 The Enterprise travels through space as:
 PICARD, RIKER, TROI, DATA, WORF, and ENSIGN TESS ALLENBY at their positions.
 An alien woman, SONGI, appears -- a gentle, sensitive creature who speaks with quiet desperation.
 GEORDI emerges from the miners' shuttle -- a small, ragged vessel that looks like the space equivalent of to suggest middle-age. Though his appearance is feral, he will emerge as an intelligent, if inflexible, being.

 Save the impulse engine for a controlled entry.
 The red-brown sphere begins to fill the window.
 A merciless sun beats down on a sere desert of rolling sand dunes. The shuttle lies, half buried in sand, charred and broken. The hatch has ripped off and we see Picard emerge, blinking in the harsh light and then turning to help Wesley climb out.
 The ship maintains a distant orbit around a large blue and green planet. In much closer orbit is an enormous space ship with no markings, dark and ominous.
 Riker with Data, Geordi, Beverly, Worf and Allenby.
 The three men have salvaged what they could from the cabin of the shuttlecraft. They have fashioned wraps to cover their heads and shield their eyes, with flaps covering the backs of their necks. Wesley is repairing a damaged tricorder. Picard is laying broken strips of the metal hull on the sand.

 Wesley smiles, then turns and starts off again. Dirgo watches him, then surreptitiously removes a bottle from his pocket. It contains a clear liquid; he tips the bottle and draws deeply on it. Then he covertly replaces it.

 Beverly is briefing assistants. There is a determined quality to her, as though it's important to concentrate on business.
 Riker stands over Geordi as he works at the Science Station. Tess and Data, off-camera, at their posts. An Okudagram represents the construction module in the process of attaching thrusters to the waste ship. Worf turns to them.
 The waste vessel begins to move, sluggishly but steadily. Then, suddenly, a chunk of it rips off.

 Wesley springs instantly into action, holstering his tricorder, climbing to his feet and running toward the Captain. Dirgo seems frozen with fear, staring at the wounded man on the ground.
 Picard is lying on the ground as Wesley frantically administers first aid. Dirgo still seems sluggish, in shock.
 The Enterprise tows the heavy barge through space.

 Radiation intensity is decreasing, Commander.
 Wesley piles some rocks together. Picard is unconscious. He looks flushed and feverish; his condition has deteriorated in the last few hours. Wesley aims his phaser at a rock and zaps. It glows, warming them. Picard stirs, opens his eyes.

 A weary group, including Riker, Data, Geordi, and Beverly study an Okudagram at Data's station. Worf is at Tactical.
 Wesley, too, has been up all night. His eyes are red-rimmed, but he sticks gamely to his task. He is working on both the tricorder and his communicator, modifying them. He takes something from the communicator, inserts it into the tricorder, makes a few adjustments, tries it. He hears the Captain stir and moan, and moves toward him. Picard's eyes open. He looks awful -- his face grey but flushed in spots with fever. His voice is hoarse.

 Wesley sits propped against the cave wall, Picard's head resting in his lap. Picard sleeps, or is unconscious. Wesley stares at the fire, trying to keep his eyes open. But he has been up too long, and through too much. His eyes droop shut, snap open, then close again and stay that way.

 Troi is even more disoriented and dizzy, having trouble focusing her eyes. She knocks a vase to the floor. It shatters.
 Recommend we run a diagnostic on the forward sensor array. We don't want a ghost tailing us all the way to T'lli Beta.
 Troi tries to reach a couch, doesn't get that far. She clutches her head, knees buckling, as she crumples to the floor, unconscious.
 Motionless in space.
 As before.
 Geordi, on the move, checking readings... everyone's putting themselves back together from the shake... RED ALERT alarms and lights continue in the background.

 Troi is on her couch, head held in hands, now apparently in excruciating pain. Troi slows her breathing, touches her insignia.

 Geordi is looking at his instruments.
 Ensign, bring us around ninety degrees to starboard from our current heading...
 Geordi is at his control panels. The impulse engines are straining, but not alarmingly.
 Data looks up from his instruments.
 The door opens and Beverly ENTERS. Troi is sitting on her couch, appearing to be in much less pain than previously, but she's still rubbing her head.
 Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, Geordi, Beverly, Troi.
 As she seems to be experiencing a growing puzzlement.
 Mister Worf, your analysis.

 Troi interrupts, terrified.
 Still being pulled off-center at sub-light through space.
 Troi is sitting on a diagnostic table as Beverly finishes examining her, looking up at the readout above the bed. Riker stands by.
 Troi is at a table intensely focused on a report when the door chimes, startling her. She looks up, a little annoyed.
 The Enterprise is still being pulled off-center. A probe is suddenly launched from the ship.
 Data and Geordi at a computer console which displays a moving graphic representation of the probe's POV.

 Beverly is going about her work with some medical equipment when Troi comes in.
 Troi is walking quickly along the corridor, avoiding the SUPERNUMERARIES who walk by. Her anger is turning to panic as she finally reaches her quarters and goes inside.
 Troi steps inside, the doors closing behind her. She moves to the middle of the room, stops, then slowly sits down on the floor. She puts her arms around her knees, and slowly rocks, like a terrified child.

 Troi exits the Ready Room followed a beat later by Picard. She goes into the Turbolift, leaving, as Picard sits next to Riker.
 Troi is pacing her room when the door chimes.
 Geordi moves to a companel...
 Acknowledged. I'm on my way to the Bridge.
 Still being pulled.
 Riker, Picard, Data, and Worf at their stations. Allenby keys a control at Conn.

 The energy we wanted to transfer to the nacelles was absorbed by the graviton wake instead. It set up a torsional wave that rebounded back to the ship. We're lucky the hull is still in one piece.
 Picard and Riker exchange a frustrated glance.
 Troi is sitting by herself in a corner of the room, not drinking, looking very isolated.

 Troi is, in essence, packing. Putting together personal things into an attache... The door chimes. She glances up.
 Troi ENTERS. Picard is at his desk.
 A view of the ship and the cosmic string looming ahead.
 Data is briefing Troi in front of a screen. A series of still frames of the previous probe image of the creatures appears on the screen throughout the scene. Troi appears hesitant, not confident of her role.
 Data and Troi have brought their ideas to Picard. Riker, Worf, Geordi, Allenby are present.

 The ship stopped in space.
 SUPERNUMERARIES at Con, Ops, and Tactical. Data is near the aft stations, making a visual check of the consoles. This is the "nightshift" and so lighting on the Bridge should be SLIGHTLY DARKER than we're used to seeing..
 Data ENTERS from Turbolift and moves to Keiko's Quarters.
 KEIKO ISHIKAWA, a slender young woman of Japanese descent and wearing civilian clothes, is walking from the bedroom to the living area. She seems serene... calm. The door CHIMES.
 Data moving toward Ten Forward.
 GEORDI, O'BRIEN, and SUPERNUMERARIES. The Supernumeraries are putting up Japanese lanterns, decorations, etc. Geordi and O'Brien are standing around, waiting for the rehearsal. (The lounge is closed, no regular patrons.) Data ENTERS and goes directly to O'Brien.
 The Enterprise and another starship running side by side.
 Data moving toward Transporter Room. The Corridor should be filled with SUPERNUMERARIES in Starfleet uniforms, civilian clothes, sports wear... a feeling of many cultures, activities and traditions aboard our ship.
 Data ENTERS. TRANSPORTER TECHNICIAN at console.

 Data and T'Pel ENTER from Turbolift and walk to Ready Room. Riker's shift is on duty (Riker not on Bridge).
 PICARD and Riker standing near the desk. T'Pel and Data ENTER.
 Data and Riker ENTER from Ready Room.
 Barbershops haven't changed much and there is still a mirror, two barberchairs, and a sink, along with 24th century combs, scissors, shaving cubes, etc. Geordi has just sat down in one of the chairs and an alien barber named V'SAL comes over to look at his hair.
 The 24th century equivalent of a ship's store. There are several computer terminals showing images of objects ranging from clothing to furniture. Patrons select the desired item from one of the displays, then take an encoded padd to one of the large replicator consoles in the b.g. TWO ADULTS are perusing one of the displays with a CHILD.
 The parents are making a few final adjustments to the image of a stuffed rabbit (or toy sailboat) on one of the screens. The child seems happy with the choice. They press a button, and the item MATERIALIZES on one of the replicator stages. They take the toy.
 The computer screen is showing a shovel and Data seems unsure what to do. He taps a key and the display now shows a chair.
 as Data sees WORF ENTER. Worf goes over to one of the terminals and begins to tap in commands. Data goes over to him.
 The terminal screen shows a set of crystal wine glasses.
 This is a traditional gift?
 BEVERLY is talking to a NURSE. They are in the while her HUSBAND (non-Starfleet) sits next to her. Data's V.O. can be heard over the following...
 Data is waiting for Beverly in the vestibule outside her office.
 What?
 Picard and T'Pel are standing near aft science station. Riker and his shift are still on duty. Data ENTERS.
 Moving at warp speed.
 Riker and his shift still on duty. Data is working at the aft science station... after a few seconds, he stands and goes over to the Ready Room door.
 Picard and T'Pel are seated. The door CHIMES.
 Data ENTERS. He crosses to the food replicator.
 as a CAT walks over to the dish of food and begins eating.
 as he sits at the desk. He places his hand on the console and a small series of LIGHTS COME ON in response.
 as O'Brien ENTERS. He's upset, but somewhat apologetic.
 Data walking to the Arboretum.
 Data ENTERS. The Arboretum is a large, well-kept nursery... lots of trees, bushes, flowers, etc. Keiko (in lab coat) is staring at a flowering plant, lost in thought.
 CLOSE ON a cup, as TROI pours tea into it. MOVE WITH HER as she picks up the cup, crosses the room and sits down on the couch with Data. (This action must be long enough for Data's voice-over to be heard.)
 The ship at warp.
 (No windows... similar to the quarters in "Sarek") T'Pel is pacing, a little restless for a Vulcan, but not nervous. The door CHIMES.
 Data ENTERS from T'Pel's quarters. He heads for a Turbolift.
 Data steps up to the keypad outside the Holodeck doors and presses a button.
 The Studio is plain: wood floor, mirror, practice beam. Data ENTERS. Beverly is already here warming up. She sees Data and comes over... she's excited to be dancing again.
 Computer, create dance partner, female.
 The ship at warp.
 Data ENTERS. Riker's shift still on duty. Riker is telling a joke to the Supernumeraries at Tactical and the Aft Science station. Data watches Riker as he moves to Ops and takes his station. Data's V.O. can be heard over Riker's joke.
 The ship goes into warp.
 As before.
 The image of MENDAK, a Romulan Admiral, comes on the screen. His attitude is neutral... a shrewd negotiator careful not to give anything away.
 as Worf reads his console.
 Picard, Data, and Riker are listening to O'Brien's report. Geordi, Beverly and a MEDICAL TECHNICIAN are examining the Transporter pad in the b.g. with a couple of tricorders. The Technician has a carrying case into which residual samples from the Transporter pad are being placed. Data's V.O. can be heard over the following...
 Picard, Data, Riker, and Worf. Mendak is on the viewscreen.
 Data working at the pool table.
 A short time later. Data and Geordi running some tests on a console... Geordi getting frustrated.
 Data and O'Brien running tests on the Transporter... objects DEMATERIALIZE and REMATERIALIZE.
 Data ENTERS. Beverly is working at a lab table with a large scanning/analysis device with a single computer screen and keypad built into it.
 Transporter information comes up on the terminal screen.
 All right... there's the genetic record of the Ambassador when she beamed aboard the Enterprise.
 Data, Geordi, Riker, and Picard.
 Riker, Geordi, Data, and Picard ENTER from Ready Room and take their positions.
 The ship at warp.

 Mendak's image appears.
 Another Romulan ship DECLOAKS and now two Romulans are facing the Enterprise.

 The Enterprise turns and moves away.
 As before... PUSH IN on Data.
 Keiko is scanning a tree with a tricorder. In contrast to her earlier attitude, she is bright and cheerful. Data ENTERS.
 The ship stopped in space.
 He is looking at something o.s.... Japanese wedding MUSIC (called gagaku) is playing in the b.g. After a few seconds, MOVE TO reveal Data (dress uniform, with a boutonniere) standing in Ten Forward, which is decorated for the wedding. This is a celebration of two cultures (Japanese & Irish) and there should fixtures from both.
 Picard is standing in front of the center window with O'Brien before him and Geordi standing in place as best man. (All three in dress uniforms) A white, earthenware goblet sits on a table next to O'Brien. Riker and Troi (in standard uniforms) are standing to one side and there are SUPERNUMERARIES gathered around.
 She is kneeling in prayer off to one side of the room. She is wearing a semi-traditional Japanese wedding kimono of black silk, with a few modern touches.
 as Data and Keiko move to O'Brien. Data hands the bride to him and then he takes the goblet from the table and hands it to Keiko. She drinks from it in three quick sips and then hands it to O'Brien. He also drinks in three sips. Data takes the goblet and sets it back on the table. Everyone now looks to Picard
 as O'Brien kisses Keiko... and everyone CHEERS. The Japanese music is replaced by a bright, lively, IRISH TUNE and people gather round to congratulate the happy couple.
 a short time later as Data dances gracefully with the new bride.
 The ship moving at warp speed.
 Data ENTERS (now in standard uniform). The room is quiet and dark. Picard (still in dress uniform) and the Nurse are near a small cradle... the Nurse gesture to the cradle and then walks away from Picard as if she had just showed him the way over there. Picard looks down for a beat and then notices Data.

 O'Brien, humming a little tune, carries a steaming casserole from the replicator, puts it on the table, where Keiko sits.

 The Okudagram shows that the Cardassian ship has turned toward the Phoenix and is rapidly bearing down on it.
 Mister Data, overlay weapon ranges of the two ships...
 O'Brien doing routine maintenance at his console. The doors slide open and Picard ENTERS. O'Brien straightens up, surprised.

 Picard, Riker, Data, and Macet. The Turbolift door opens and Worf ENTERS, holding the Cardassian Glinn Telle in a strong grip.
 Macet and Picard ENTER. Macet begins.

 Riker and O'Brien wait as a figure MATERIALIZES on the pad. Seconds later, CAPTAIN BENJAMIN MAXWELL steps off. He is not at all what one might have expected. Slight of build, short greying hair, chiseled, angular face -- he could be Lenin. Or Lennon.

 As they exit, Data still in costume, pushes a few holodeck computer buttons to end the program, then walks with Picard... a few supernumeraries glance at them as they pass...
 WORF, RIKER at their positions. As Picard ENTERS...

 Picard is seated in the Command Chair. Riker, Worf and Data are at their stations. Supernumerary at Conn.
 Beam up Doctor Clark by himself... Mister Worf, escort him to my ready room...
 Dr. Clark, still shaky, is seated as Picard fetches two cups of tea...
 Picard and Clark ENTER. Data, Worf, Riker, TROI present. On the viewscreen: JARED, a dignified man, dressed in contemporary 24th century clothes, paces with a handful of aides in the Atheneum.
 Picard, Riker, Troi, Worf, GEORDI, BEVERLY, Data and Dr. Clark are seated around the conference table.
 A large agrarian city with evidence of turmoil... smoke from fires... an alien siren blares... some burned out structures.
 Picard, Worf, Troi and Data MATERIALIZE... the sentries are posted at the door... Jared and his small circle of aides move toward Picard.
 Ardra walks gingerly through the fallen debris. She is by no means overly-dramatic in an anti-Christ sort of way, in fact she underplays the role entirely... she's much more the William Morris agent than the classic devil. When she approaches one of the Ventaxians, they cower and back away in fear.

 I've arranged for a bit of privacy... just the two of us.
 Picard APPEARS in the science station in his bedclothes. Most of the debris has been cleared away and some of the equipment is back in working order. Several SCIENCE STATION WORKERS are huddled over various machine components. Geordi and Dr. Clark are conferring in one corner, look up in surprise at Picard.
 Data is at the helm, piloting Picard back to the Enterprise, which is visible in the distance. Picard is adjusting the top of the uniform...
 as the shuttle nears the shuttle bay. But suddenly, the Enterprise vanishes. The shuttle is alone in space.
 Picard leans forward and speaks into the communicator.
 Data is at a monitor, with Picard close by. Geordi and Dr. Clark are working at nearby equipment.
 As Ardra appears...
 The hearing is held in the round, distinctly different than our own courtroom experience. The questioner (at the moment, Ardra) is in the center, moving around at will, asking questions of any witness she chooses. Data is in a neutral position between Picard and Ardra's chair. Also present is Jared. There are no spectators. Ardra addresses Jared --
 Or this?
 Ardra returns to normal.
 Geordi is closely monitoring the instrument in the reconstructed science station. Dr. Clark is nearby on another monitor... his assistants are also working nearby.

 WORF, dressed in a Klingon robe is leading several others, including TROI, RIKER and GEORDI in a set of slow exercises, that might be described as Klingon Tai Chi.
 At a lab counter, BEVERLY is lining several small incubation bottles along a rack -- obviously an experimental procedure. Her satisfied smile indicates that she's enjoying this.

 Sensors indicate an energy fluctuation directly in our path. Source unknown.
 A shimmering "hole" in space opens up for just a moment Worf looks at his instruments.
 Still picking up energy distortions -- but fading. It seems to be gone.
 The entire Bridge crew looks towards the screen just as the Enterprise goes into the worm-hole. A dazzling light fills the Bridge, as we stay on Data, who can barely be seen pouring over his sensor readings. Then the light just as suddenly fades to normal.

 I'm getting scattered reports of minor injuries. What happened?
 Ship's status?
 The ship launches a probe, which speeds across space and out of frame.
 Beverly is treating O'BRIEN, running a hand-held instrument over the Chief's elbow. In the background, ALYSSA OGAWA and another medical assistant are treating two other crew members.
 as she crosses into a lab on the other side of Sickbay.
 Beverly finds the hand-held instrument she's looking for, and in passing, notices the small glass containers we saw her experimenting with earlier. Something stops her dead in her tracks.

 Beverly is walking back towards O'Brien, carrying the instrument she went for, a bemused look still on her face.
 Worf looks up from his instruments.
 Picard appears convinced. Riker still a bit doubtful.
 Picard is sitting at his desk as Beverly Crusher ENTERS, carrying a small, box-like carrier.
 Travelling at impulse speed through space, no longer near a dust cloud.
 Picard, Beverly, Data, Geordi, Riker, Worf. On the table in front of them sits one of Beverly's incubation bottles.
 Data is helping a SUPERNUMERARY engineer, (NELSON), with standard sensor diagnostics. Geordi enters frame, seemingly buoyant.
 Beverly ENTERS, steps up to O'Brien, who is at the transporter controls, entering a report into a small computer peripheral.
 Beverly is holding a small instrument over the lower arm of a young woman, ENSIGN LOCKLIN, who is sitting on a diagnostic bed. As she continues to slowly move the device, Beverly and her assistant Alyssa Ogawa monitor the screen behind them.
 What is it, Doctor?
 Picard and Beverly are walking quickly along a corridor.

 On Geordi as he emerges from the tube into the presence of Picard and Dr. Crusher.
 Data is standing in front of Picard.
 Establish heading at impulse through space.
 The side of Data's head is open and blinking. Geordi has a small, pen-like device in hand. He's trying to keep things light, but it's a cover -- he's clearly uncomfortable with this assignment.
 Picard is at the helm; Riker, Worf, the Ensign and Troi are at their respective stations.
 Troi and Worf walk up to Troi's door.
 Worf ENTERS, but Troi is not in the main part of her cabin. He dashes towards the washroom.
 Troi is sitting in bed as Beverly finishes running an instrument around her head. Picard is standing nearby.
 Geordi is standing in front of a monitor displaying an image of the same Neptune-like planet the probe relayed earlier back to the Enterprise.
 Beverly returns to see Worf waiting...
 Data, Picard and Geordi are standing around the monitor screen in Data's quarters, staring at the image of the Neptune-like planet, with various numbers and symbols across the screen.
 Beverly and Worf are with Picard.
 Picard strides towards his chair, as Worf and Beverly take their respective positions. Riker, Geordi and McKnight are already at theirs posts.
 A sandy-brown planet.
 Speeding through space at warp speed.
 The Ensign glances up from her instruments.
 In front of the ship is a green, rectangular, glowing field.
 The energy-pulse, a glowing green missile, strikes the Enterprise shields, spreads in a shower of fluorescence, and fades.
 Worf is staring at his instruments.
 Troi is asleep in her bed. Suddenly a green glow suffuses her room, and slowly coalesces around her head, until it seems to disappear into her. Troi sits up, her face blank.
 Data rises from his chair as the door opens and Troi ENTERS.
 Data and Geordi ENTER. Geordi goes to his station while Data approaches Picard. Picard stands. The planet with a green energy field in front of it is on the viewscreen.
 FADE IN:
 Picard is still stunned at Data's revelation.
 The rectangular green field interposed between the Enterprise and the planet is moving steadily towards the ship.
 Maintain shields at full intens--
 The rectangular green glow has draped itself outside and over the invisible shields, and seems to be pulsing and changing its shape -- shrinking, then expanding, over and over, not getting any closer to the ship.
 Worf looks up from his instruments.
 The flashback begins immediately after the teaser scene. Data sees that everyone is slumped or sprawled on the Bridge.
 Data is telling his story.

 CLOSE SHOT of Picard, unconscious, beginning to come around... Data goes to assist him as before.
 The ship just went through a wormhole. The entire crew was unconscious for approximately thirty seconds.
 Status reports?
 The Enterprise at impulse speed.
 CLOSE ON a wide sliding door opening... TWO MALCORIAN MEDICAL TECHNICIANS rush someone on a gurney through the doors and into a small room crowded with medical equipment for emergency trauma care. The level of technology in evidence is approximately mid 21st century Earth with just enough differences to tell us that this is an alien world. There are two treatment bed/tables, cabinets and trays with medical instruments, and a display for reading scans. The Malcorians are humanoid with a slight difference in facial features... their hands are shaped like mittens without fingers (and if this is a difficult makeup job, they can all wear gloves.)
 Close on Riker in a bed, head bandaged, monitors working... waking up... he gropes for his bearings a second, then reacts as he sees --
 including Nilrem and Tava are at the foot of his bed, watching him with extraordinary curiosity... Riker feels the pain in his head...
 As the group comes out. Tava moves to Berel...
 A large, metropolitan city that could be from mid 21st century Earth, with a few alien touches. Moving in on an impressive government building...
 DURKEN is the leader of his people and this is a fitting office for a man of his stature, oval shaped with windows that look outside. Durken himself is in his fifties, slight in stature, no Ronald Reagan here, there is a gentle, Woodrow Wilson quality, thoughtful, brilliant, committed. With him here is MIRASTA, a woman 30-35 years old, and the Minister for Internal Security, KROLA. He is older than Durken, with a keen intellect and piercing eyes. Two other non-speaking members of the cabinet are present.
 From this room, a person can personally supervise and control rocket launches, satellite operations, radio and optical telescope functions, receive telemetry, etc. If the head of NASA wanted to be completely monitors, printers, observational equipment, models of spacecraft, etc.
 As they MATERIALIZE... she reacts, astounded. Worf and Beverly are there to greet them. SUPERNUMERARY at transport.
 In orbit.
 Picard, Troi and Mirasta ENTER...
 Berel enters to see the hallway is full of doctors and nurses and medical personnel talking in hushed voices...
 As Berel enters... Riker is awake...
 Pulling back to see Durken at his desk studying documents, stamping a few...
 Picard, Durken, Mirasta walking away from the transporter. Worf and Beverly trail and quickly go their separate ways...
 As they ENTER.
 DATA is in the Command Chair. WORF and supernumeraries fill the other posts. The door opens, Picard, Durken, and Mirasta ENTER. Data stands in greeting.
 And the planet below. Durken can't completely suppress his wonder.
 Picard pours two glasses from his bottle of Chateau Picard...
 Riker is on his feet, battling the pain in his head and dizziness... he looks in the closet and finds the clothes he wore when he was brought in, starts to get dressed...
 he examines it... it is sealed shut... as he begins to look for something he can use to break it, a nurse (LANEL) ENTERS the room. She stops short as she sees Riker at the window, but instead of crying out for help, she glances out toward the guard and allows the door to close with her inside. She is quite nervous.
 A GUARD is stationed outside Riker's room. Lanel rushes out, apparently upset...
 shooting past Riker... Nilrem and another physician turn the corner walking toward him... react as they see him...
 Riker is in surgery... they're working on his forehead below his hair line... Berel in surgical clothes works carefully but quickly... but is confused by what he is encountering... Tava assists... two other medical assistants are present... with urgency --
 The cabinet, including Mirasta and Krola, have just been told the facts of life by Durken. Durken is on his feet... the others are seated...
 Riker is attached to monitoring equipment, still unconscious... pull back to see Krola entering with Berel.
 Finding Durken silhouetted against the tall window as he looks out, his hands folded behind his back, a thoughtful pose. He turns to the sound of the transporter effect...
 as Picard MATERIALIZES.
 On Berel who is on a telephone like device.
 Close on Riker's bandaged face as he regains consciousness... he is in bad shape... the pain in his head is suffocating and yet the drugs in his system won't let him rest... there is a drugged intensity in his eyes... on the monitors, graphs measuring his life signs make beeping sounds which move more quickly as the drugs take hold. He cannot raise his head. As we pull back, he sees Krola and Nilrem.
 As Mirasta ENTERS...
 The interrogation continues. Riker is exhausted.
 Krola aims it at a lamp in the corner and destroys it.

 As the ship slowly moves out of orbit, leaving the planet behind.
 At impulse power.
 as the door opens and GEORDI ENTERS; PICARD is at his desk.
 Geordi sits at the bar, drinking juice and trying to stay calm. But he's clearly a little hyper... keeps brushing invisible lint from his uniform. GUINAN is behind the bar, eyeing all this.
 Geordi waits with TRANSPORTER TECHNICIAN.
 as the shimmering effect occurs and LEAH BRAHMS MATERIALIZES. She looks a little different than she did in "Booby Trap"... her hair is styled differently, fuller... she's a few years older but the maturity looks good on her. She has the same kind face and intelligent eyes... but there's something off about her... a set to the mouth, a sharpness. The softness and vulnerability aren't as evident. She gazes around the room, getting her bearings. Geordi approaches her, smiling broadly.
 at warp speed.
 Leah is stalking the engine room like a panther, checking everything, registering her finds on a Padd. Geordi follows her, well able to stay up with her barrage of questions, but feeling inescapably on the defensive. ENSIGN PAVLIK can be seen working in the b.g.
 RIKER, DATA, and WORF at their stations. ENSIGN RAGER at Con.
 The ship drops out of warp in a star system.
 Picard is now standing near Ops with Riker.
 The viewer shows a large gas giant planet with a barely perceptible smudge of energy near the horizon.
 Leah returns, icy as ever. But Geordi has had a few minutes to assess the situation, and has decided to take another tack. He smiles at her... warm... poised... confident.
 The ship and energy being are in orbit around the planet. The energy being is almost the size of the saucer section of the Enterprise.
 Everyone still at their stations. There are a few more SCIENCE SUPERNUMERARIES at the aft stations.
 The ship and the energy being.
 Picard watching the energy being on the screen as it gets bigger. Troi has come to the Bridge... joins Picard to watch with him.
 The creature suddenly sends out large energy tendrils which fasten onto the Enterprise and hold it.
 As before. The ship ROCKS as the being latches on.
 Geordi and a couple of ENGINEERS are shaken up as the ship ROCKS. They react and move quickly to their stations.
 As before.
 Geordi at one of the monitors.
 As before.
 There is a sudden burst of color from within the creature as the phasers rip into it. The effect is crushing. The colors within the creature begin to mute.
 There is no joy of victory on this Bridge. Nothing's been won.
 FADE IN:
 The Enterprise near the now lifeless form of the creature.
 INT. MAIN BRIDGE
 Captain, sensors are picking up a new energy reading from the lifeform.
 Geordi is putting the finishing touches on a table setting... flowers, all the spiffy stuff. He inspects it, then glances around the room. Geordi is wearing a very casual outfit.
 Picard joins Riker and Data at Science Station One. They are studying the remains of the creature, specifically the one little spot of energy within the body of the creature.
 On the Science station monitor, the glob of new energy pushes itself against the inner wall of the dead being.
 This new concentration of energy was detected only after the surrounding material became inert.
 Some twelve hours have passed. The offspring is still unable to push its way out of its parent's body.
 BEVERLY, Picard, Riker, Worf, and Troi.
 Geordi's at a monitor, working. His attitude -- developed after much tossing and turning all night -- is professional and detached. He barely looks up as Leah ENTERS. She, on the other hand, seems friendlier than before. Or maybe just more rested. (NOTE: Neither of them should be in jumpsuits yet.)
 (NOTE: Now their jumpsuits are on.) Some kind of cramped, narrow tube they're crawling through... with almost no room to maneuver... and very, very close. Leah's face is smudged with grease, her hair is messed... and she looks adorable. The characteristic THRUM of the engines can be heard in the b.g.
 Beverly is standing at the Tactical station with Worf. Picard, Riker, Troi at Command. Data at an aft station.
 The Enterprise emits a thin phaser beam, which gently touches the edge of the creature near the offspring and makes an incision.
 Beverly and Data study the information on their respective consoles.
 The offspring pushes against the inner edge. A rent appears. The offspring slowly emerges through the incision.
 As before. Everyone watching the child emerging on the viewer. It is about a tenth of the size of the parent.
 Close on Geordi, looking dejected, at the bar. Tearing a napkin into little tiny shreds, focusing intently on this process as though it were of life-saving importance. As he continues, pull back to reveal Guinan listening...
 Picard, Riker, Data, Troi, and Worf at their stations. Everyone watching the image of the creature on the viewscreen.
 The ship starts to move away from the creature... but the small being quickly follows the ship.
 As before.
 The view changes to a shot of the creature attached to the secondary hull between the warp nacelles.
 Suddenly the lights dim, come up and dim again in a rhythmic pulse.
 The ship slowly moving on impulse power with the energy being still attached to the hull.
 Picard, Riker, Data, Beverly, Geordi, and Leah.
 as Geordi and Leah exit the Observation Lounge, both thinking out loud about the problem at hand. There's no strain between them now... they're two professionals working out a problem.

 She went where?
 Leah stands, rapt, watching herself in the set of drafting room five, Utopia Planitia.
 The energy being is still attached to the hull.
 Data is at one of the aft science stations. Picard and Riker are nearby, Worf at his station.
 The ship moves on impulse power toward the asteroid belt.
 As before.
 Geordi is at the controls... he works the console.
 The door OPENS, revealing the creature's body covering about 3/4 of the opening.
 I'm deactivating the atmospheric force field now, Captain.
 There is an optical EFFECT at the bay door as the force field is shut down. A WHOOSHING sound can be heard as the air in the bay rushes toward the opening. The creature's body ruffles and shakes violently as it tries to hang on despite the fierce pressure.
 The ship SHAKES and the lights begin to flicker.
 Geordi is looking out at the bay. The air has stopped rushing out, but the creature is still attached to the ship.
 I am detecting other radio transmissions, Captain.
 The screen shows a large field of asteroids. Slowly, several other creatures like the parent can be seen moving toward the ship.

 The creatures are getting closer.
 As before. On Picard's reaction...

 Picard, Riker, Data, Worf.
 Geordi and Leah entering commands at the pool table.
 Negative. I detect no reduction in the lifeform's rate of energy consumption.
 Okay... not sour enough. Leah, take it down further.
 The lifeform is emitting its high frequency transmission... energy consumption is rising...
 Just a little more time, Captain--! Nudge it down... toward point-oh-two...
 Intercept in thirty seconds.
 Point oh-eight... oh-five... oh-three... now at point oh-two centimeters...
 The ship continues to ROCK and lights flicker wildly.
 The entity has disengaged, sir.
 Geordi and Leah react to this good news...

 The small Bridge is, on first sight, empty. BEVERLY, Riker, Worf, Data, and Troi MATERIALIZE at the rear of the Bridge. They look around the quiet room, getting their bearings. Data heads for a computer station, keys information.

 Picard watches with Beverly as a SUPERNUMERARY wheels away a form in a body bag.
 The small ship hangs in space.
 Data and Riker at the computers. GEORDI ENTERS from the turbolift.
 Picard working at his desk. The door CHIMES.
 Captain Zaheva, sitting in the same chair where she was found, is a wreck... eyes red-rimmed, voice hoarse, endlessly brushing the side of her head in a compulsive gesture.
 Troi is leaving Sickbay, speaks to a SUPERNUMERARY. (PRODUCTION NOTE: This is the beginning of the dream sequence, but should seem perfectly normal.)
 As it opens, she ENTERS.
 Suddenly Troi steps into a bizarre surreality. She spins to find the door she entered. It is gone. She turns back to see she is in...
 A strange, empty cavity where everything is fuzzy, smoky, gaseous. Vague shapes seem to loom in the distance but have no substance. At a great distance, there are two pinpoints of light... the mists swirl in front of them, obscuring them. A RUSTLING SOUND, maybe wind, maybe a cry, seems to come from within the shadowy depths. It is an ominous, menacing sound, suggesting a demon lurking in the mists. Troi finds herself floating... drifting helplessly in the clouds. It is frightening to be so out of control.
 as she is drawn toward the sinister sound, unable to resist. She drifts further into the vaporous landscape, seeking the source. But she cannot control her direction.
 Troi, in her bed, sits up with a start. She is moist with perspiration, breathing hard in terror from the bizarre nightmare.

 Geordi and ENSIGN PEEPLES at a work station.
 as he concentrates on his task, tapping out instructions. As he does, we begin to hear a SOUND... a hollow, deadened CLUNG... as though something were hitting a pipe somewhere far below.
 As soon as Geordi is included in the shot, the SOUND disappears. Geordi is staring at the Ensign.
 Now, the sound is loud and clear.
 Geordi's stare catches Peeples' attention, and then he realizes he's not hearing anything.
 Troi sits by the bio-bed where Hagan lies.
 O'Brien paces in the front room, disquieted. Presently the door opens and Keiko comes bustling in, happy to see him.
 O'Brien ENTERS, spots his friend CHIEF GILLESPIE sitting at the bar. Gillespie is older than O'Brien, weathered and salty. O'Brien walks over and joins him. GUINAN is behind the bar.
 Picard is at his desk, working. The door CHIMES.
 Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, Ensign Rager at Conn.

 Mister Worf, ready tractor beam.
 I don't know, sir... nothing's responding...

 At the table sit Picard, Riker, Troi, Beverly, and Geordi. Data stands at the monitor. The staff is looking a little ragged... mildly disheveled, slightly on edge. Riker drums his fingers on the table. Picard tugs at his collar in an unconscious, compulsive gesture. Troi looks more exhausted than ever. Data, of course, is unchanged.
 Picard and Riker ENTER. Picard tugs at his collar.

 Riker ENTERS, then stops and listens warily, as though hearing something. He scans the room. Then he shakes it off, proceeds toward the bedroom.
 Picard stares upward in horror, backing to a wall, holding up a hand as though to ward off the ceiling.

 Riker ENTERS, studies the room, moves through it cautiously. He turns and looks back at the door he just entered.
 Picard looks upward, shielding his head as --
 rushes down at him, threatening to crush him...
 No! No!
 The turbolift door opens. Worf, at his station, looks over to see --
 huddled on the floor in terror, hands protectively over his head.
 as he moves toward the Captain, staring in amazement.
 Dressed in a sleep robe, he goes to his bed, takes the cover and starts to flip it back. Then he whirls suddenly, looking behind him.
 Quiet, still -- empty.

 fights for control... quiets her pounding heart.
 Beverly is with Picard and Data.
 Troi sits by the bio-bed where Hagan lies. Her head rests against the wall and her eyes are fluttering closed. CAMERA DRIFTS in toward her as:
 from Troi's first nightmare... the void... the hazy, murky cavity... the lights, the sighing sound, Troi floating, calling...
 Troi drifts toward the lights, discerning something in the distance... an indistinct shape...
 Troi's eyes blink open and she sits up, looking around fuzzily, realizes she was dreaming. She turns to Hagan.
 Beverly is with a patient on a bio-bed, to whom is attached neurotransmitter monitors. Beverly is pale and shaky, trying hard to hold it all together, but discouraged.
 A few desultory souls... the mood is nervous, somber -- not a happy place. Guinan circulates; you sense she's keeping tensions under control. Gillespie is there, and not in good shape... irritable, impulsive. He's trying to garner support.
 Guinan shakes her head in disdain and moves off.
 Data ENTERS to find Geordi. Geordi is not in good shape... shaky and ragged. It's costing him effort to hang in there. Peeples is working in the background.
 Picard, Riker, Worf, Troi, and Lin. Again, everyone reflects their diminished circumstances.
 The main deflector dish begins to glow.
 Geordi and Data are intent upon their monitors, and do not see Peeples approaching Geordi from behind.
 Discharge in three seconds... two... one...
 A thin, reedy beam flicks out from the deflector... and then sputters and snuffs out like a defective firecracker.
 Nothing... it just fizzled out...
 as he stands, tight-lipped, in reaction to this failure.
 No, sir. If we draw more power, we risk losing life-support systems.
 as, unseen by most, he turns and walks off the Bridge.

 The door opens and Worf ENTERS and prowls, as though searching for something. He goes to the wall which contains the bat'telh sword... lifts it from its frame, studies it... then returns it to its place.
 as he approaches a table, reaches for a long, decorative box. He opens it.

 Acting Captain's log, stardate of the Enterprise at the request of Captain Picard. Our situation is deteriorating; many of the crew are unable to function and our life support systems are beginning to falter.
 Troi with Hagan.
 Beverly... I know what it is... I know what's happening...
 Data, Troi, Beverly, and Picard. The others are noticeable by their absence. The group that is there, except for Data, is in bad shape. They are unkempt, hair in disarray and eyes red-rimmed. They are on the edge of an emotional abyss, all struggling mightily to keep from toppling over. Beverly is unable to sit still, and keeps jumping up to pace. Picard is straining to remain cogent, but keeps his hands tightly clasped, as though to hold onto sanity. Troi is possessed of an urgency that threatens to overwhelm her.
 Troi with Beverly. Beverly is shaky, keeps brushing at her hair, but gamely hanging on to her concentration.
 Picard at command, struggling to stay focused. Data is at Ops. No one else is on the Bridge.
 as the group hears Data's announcement. O'Brien and Gillespie are among them.
 She quietly touches a com panel.
 We don't even know what we're dying for...
 There is a brief scuffle. The guards are disarmed. Gillespie and his group push to the front.
 I say... Captain owes us some answers... let's go...

 Beverly with Troi, who is asleep on the bio-bed, electrodes attached. A NURSE attends.
 Thank you, Doctor. Activating the Bussard collectors.
 The collectors on the engine nacelles begin to emit a thin stream of red gas.
 Camera DRIFTS into Troi's face as she sleeps.
 Troi is floating in the mists... the twin lights glow through the fog... the sighing voice calls from beyond... Troi drifts deeper into the foggy emptiness...
 The streams of hydrogen are reaching further into space.
 We have ninety seconds remaining.
 Troi turns back toward the lights, floats on through the swirling vapors... the blurred and indistinct shapes seem a long way off.
 Beverly tries to concentrate on the brain scanner monitor.
 Where are you? I have to find you... I have to tell you...
 The streams of hydrogen now reach deep into space.
 Forty-five seconds remaining.
 The voice is louder now, deafening... a wind has swirled the fog into grotesque shapes and patterns... it's hard going... Troi falls to the ground...
 Thirty seconds...
 Troi looks up to see --
 A dark figure, no more than a shadow, moving toward her from the gloom.
 stares at him, startled.
 Ten seconds.
 From the collectors, the last of the hydrogen stretches into space... a long, long way...
 as Data and Picard watch... the beam knifes through the darkness... disappears in the distance... they wait... wait... The lights dim further...
 A brilliant pyrotechnical display... an explosion, which illuminates the funnel-shaped %7F%7Frift" in which they have been trapped.
 as Picard and Data see the explosion, roiling and raging. There is a hum as power is restored and lights snap on. Picard rises... instinctively knowing what to do...
 grabs power, accelerates, skims through the last sparks of the diminishing explosion... directly into the center of the rift...
 Troi smiles... then her eyes flutter open as she comes awake.
 The Enterprise clears the event and emerges into the quiet starfield once more.
 as the ship streaks away.
 A VISUAL OVERLAY, complete with ticking stardate, is superimposed over a dark, desolate landscape of spindly black plants and shadowy dunes... a world of perpetual twilight.
 As they hurry toward Hickman and Mendez.
 This has all taken place on the wall MONITOR. A slightly older Susanna stands beside it, pointing to their images as she speaks...
 At warp speed.
 Geordi and Susanna at a table, drinking drinks. There's a subtext here... both have to wonder if they're in some kind of danger... but they try to mask it with casual humor and small talk...
 Picard, Riker, WORF, DATA at their positions; ENSIGN GRAHAM at the helm; SUPERNUMERARIES as needed.
 A Federation shuttle speeding through space. Susanna watches the view screen, takes a nervous breath.
 Approaching TARCHANNEN THREE, a grey orb visible in the distance.
 Riker's on his feet. Geordi stands by Data at Ops.
 The shuttlecraft continues on toward Tarchannen at faster speed.
 Data responds to his console...
 It flies toward the planet and burns into the atmosphere. A spectacular FLASH, some stray sparks... then nothing.
 Riker, Worf, Picard, Geordi, and finally Susanna... shocked. Then...
 After five years, sand dunes have begun to encroach upon the abandoned facility.
 A dark and gloomy landscape... trapped in a perpetual twilight. Riker, Worf, Data, Geordi and Susanna MATERIALIZE in a clearing near a SHUTTLECRAFT. They flick on their palm beacons and move toward it, Susanna in the lead.
 Checks the side of the shuttle for identification... finds it.
 Geordi looks around the cramped interior, then glances down... and picks up a Starfleet uniform... torn to shreds.
 Susanna inspects the ground in front of the shuttle, sees something, shines her light on it and discovers...
 Scattered in the dirt... footprints which are clearly not human...
 Close by, examining the ground with his beacon. He looks up, suddenly wary. His eyes shift with a warrior's alertness as he slowly shines his light out into the darkness.
 Data is scanning the area with his Tricorder.
 Geordi EXITS the shuttle to meet with the others. He shows them the torn uniform.
 Geordi stops and looks around...
 Susanna lies in the diagnostic bed, Geordi and Beverly standing on either side of her. She opens her eyes, dazed for a moment, then quips...
 Geordi and Susanna walk along. She is clearly agitated, talking a little too fast...
 Data, Geordi, and Susanna are at an aft science station, studying the greatly magnified image of a single cell.
 Geordi and Susanna riding in it. Thinking. Then...
 In a synchronous orbit over Tarchannen.
 Data and Beverly study the data on a monitor. Then he taps it and a series of images begin flashing by.
 Footage of Tarchannen from the Teaser... without audio. The away team (including Susanna and Geordi) search the area where the uniform was found.
 Watching the monitor. Susanna sits at a nearby console, studying the image of a spindly Tarchannen plant. It's been a long session... and Susanna's clearly frayed at the edges. She frowns and nervously rubs her hand.
 Which begins playing the images from the opening of the Teaser. As Geordi watches this...
 Crosses back to the console and stares at the image of the plant... then abruptly switches the viewer off.
 Her two middle fingers are FUSED together...
 As he reacts...
 In orbit around Tarchannen Three.
 The room is dimly lit. Susanna's shadowy form lies in an emergency medical bed. As NURSE OGAWA stands by, Beverly passes an instrument over the patient...
 The changes are startling... her skin is mottled with intricately woven black patches and veins... her hair, oily and black. Geordi stares at Susanna... shocked.
 Picard and Beverly watch a wall monitor as a greatly magnified image of a single cell appears on the screen.
 And a scene from the visual record we haven't seen before: Illuminated by the stark camera lights, Susanna, Geordi, and Mendez stand outside Building One, watching as Hickman lifts an evidence case.
 Alone in his office... head aching from hours of fruitless effort, pushing himself hard. As he stares at the wall monitor...
 Beverly is met by Nurse Ogawa as she ENTERS.
 As the beam glides across Susanna's cheek a quickly fading phosphorous trail is left on the skin.
 The visual record PLAYS... beginning with the entire team at Building One again.
 As he watches, the record continues silently. Hickman DEMATERIALIZES. Susanna and the others move out of the scene, their shadows following after them. Then Geordi suddenly frowns...
 And that shadow remaining on the building wall.
 Stares hard at the screen... rubs his forehead. Annoyed. Impatient. And then the idea hits him... driving him on to an even greater effort... despite his fatigue...
 Geordi hurries up and hits the companel.
 Geordi stands near the door, studying...
 A re-creation of Building One... complete down to Tarchannen's perpetual twilight. Holograms of Susanna, Mendez, and Geordi, frozen in place... their shadows clearly visible on the wall behind them...
 As before. Geordi stares numbly at the facsimile of a healthy, vibrant Susanna... then charges on...
 A hologram of BREVELLE APPEARS between the real Geordi and the holograms of the away team. Brevelle holds a recording device with a bright light mounted on it...
 Steps up beside Brevelle... looks over at the holograms of the away team standing by the wall... so intent on his investigation that he is unaware of the increased trembling of his hands... or the sweat beading on his brow...
 Comes to "life." Susanna turns to Mendez and Geordi...
 Observes intently as...
 Geordi, Mendez and Susanna's shadows move off the wall... leaving that one strange shadow in place.
 Turns off his camera's light... and the shadow abruptly DISAPPEARS.
 His camera light comes back on... and...
 Walk in reverse back toward the building. Their shadows reappear on the wall... moving backwards... rejoining the mysterious shadow that was left behind.
 Reacts... interrupts...
 Geordi turns and faces Brevelle's camera... squinting at its bright light... there is clearly nothing between him and the light which could be casting the shadow.
 A gray figure MATERIALIZES right in front of the shadow... taking shape bit by bit until it becomes a roughly defined humanoid CREATURE.
 Reacts with astonishment as he approaches the humanoid hologram and slowly circles it... there was something there...
 The middle fingers have fused together. As his hand slides away, we see the first mottled blotches of the transformation on his neck.
 Stares at his hand... at the horror of it.
 Susanna is still in bed, further transformed, and barely conscious.
 In orbit over Tarchannen Three.
 Data is working the panels... checking further analysis... Picard is at command, Worf at Tactical, and Riker stands near Graham at the helm. As Riker crosses to Data...
 Go ahead, Doctor.
 Beverly "coming out" of surgery... the strain is clearly showing.
 Reactions.
 Captain, if Geordi has transformed, he may be virtually a chameleon -- the skin develops mimetic capabilities... he could still be onboard...
 Off Picard's reaction...
 Riker and Worf rush up from one end of the corridor; two N.D. SECURITY GUARDS from the other. Worf presses a series of buttons on the control panel and the doors slide open.
 One Security Guard stays in the doorway as Riker, Worf, and the other Guard ENTER. As they react to the Tarchannen simulation...
 Who holds up Geordi's abandoned VISOR and torn uniform.
 TRANSPORTER CHIEF HEDRICK is at his station, running a routine maintenance program. The door opens and he reacts to...
 Shaped like the hologram Geordi created; almost invisible thanks to its incredible chameleon-like skin.
 Data reacts to his console...
 Hedrick sprawled on the floor; the humanoid blur on the pad. As the DEMATERIALIZATION finishes, an energy silhouette of the Alien/Geordi is briefly visible on the pad. Then we...
 FADE IN: Worf and Data at their positions; Riker, and Picard in the command area.
 I do not read any life signs on the surface.
 Worf and Riker ENTER to discover Data at a work station, the various components of an emergency beacon laid out before him.
 Hedrick is back at his console... recovered from his encounter with the transformed Geordi.
 He beamed down next to the Aries shuttle.
 Beverly is readying her medical kit for the Away Team...
 To reveal Susanna who has regained consciousness... still part alien but her eyes once again clear and human.
 The dark, gloomy landscape... the deserted buildings.
 Riker, Beverly, Susanna, Worf, and Data MATERIALIZE near the abandoned shuttle. Data holds a foot long, baton-like emergency beacon. As they all turn on their individual palm beacons... Susanna reacts to the light, blinks, uncomfortable, turns away...
 As she slowly surveys the grey, spindly plants... the deserted dunes.
 The bright light reveals TWO TARCHANNEN CREATURES. Even in the fuzzy, fluorescent glow, their appearance is more extreme than Geordi's was... more alien.
 Partially hidden in nearby underbrush; silhouetted by the vivid blue light, barely recognizable. Reactions.
 Pursues Geordi, beacon held high, moving at top, android speed as...
 Move in pursuit... Beverly and Susanna following...
 He runs into a secluded area... stops. Pans the beacon... no Geordi. The others arrive.
 Still in orbit over grey, murky Tarchannen Three.
 In orbit around Tarchannen Three.
 A very spare, period dining room -- simple wooden table and two chairs, more functional than fancy. BEVERLY CRUSHER wears a beautiful dress; REGINALD BARCLAY, has the clothes of a duellist -- and a LARGE NOSE. They are doing CYRANO DE BERGERAC.
 RIKER, DATA, GEORDI, TROI, WORF, and a few supernumeraries still clapping.
 Well done.
 The Enterprise hovering in front of the ARGUS ARRAY. It is a huge subspace radio telescope -- a series of panels, resembling several very long box-kites stacked one on top of the other. It looks absolutely immense.
 PICARD, Riker, Worf, Data, Geordi and ENSIGN APRIL ANAYA.
 We see a panel of the Array, and hanging in front of it, a silent, probe-like device.
 The shuttle is already in space... moving away from the ship.
 Geordi at the helm, Barclay at his station.
 At this close distance, the Array can be seen only as a grey, metallic backdrop. Hanging motionless in front of it, only meters from the shuttle, is the alien probe, vaguely cylindrical, about ten meters tall and three wide.
 The ship maintaining position near the Array.
 Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, Ensign Anaya.
 Barclay is sitting up on a diagnostic bed, looking completely normal. Beverly and Geordi are standing next to him. Crusher turns to Barclay.
 Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, Ensign Anaya at their positions. RED ALERT klaxons and lights in background.
 The Array is in the distance. We gradually discern the probe approaching from its direction.
 The probe continues hanging before them as they move, inert -- no blinkies or indication of any activity -- but threatening in its silence.
 The probe is matching our speed and course.
 at impulse. The probe moving parallel.
 Options, Number One?
 The phasers fire point blank on the probe. Nothing happens.
 The staff reacts.
 Geordi is at his controls, Barclay a couple of panels down, other N.D. engineers including LIEUTENANT LINDA LARSON hurrying around to various panels, checking readings and making adjustments. The RED ALERT continues. Barclay appears to be working furiously.
 The RED ALERT continues.
 A narrow, intensely bright burst of phaser fire strikes the probe for several seconds, then stops -- no change.
 Nothing.
 at warp. The probe still alongside.
 The probe is still with us, sir.
 The RED ALERT continues. Barclay is still working feverishly at his instrument panel.
 We're too close.
 Geordi is pouring over Barclay's instrument panel, amazed.
 Continue RED ALERT as Geordi's words sink in.
 A full spread of photon torpedos fires away, hitting the probe. There is a tremendous explosion.
 The ship is buffeted terribly for several seconds, then everything calms suddenly down.
 Only the background -- the probe has vanished.
 Everyone reacts to the narrow escape. A beat as they collect themselves.
 Geordi and Barclay.
 Holding position in front of the Argus Array.
 Barclay is walking slowly along towards a turbolift, lost in thought as he glances over a PADD.
 catching up to Barclay, heading the same direction, smiling with obvious admiration.
 Picard, Data, Geordi, Troi. Barclay and Riker ENTER.
 OFF the curiosity on her face.
 Same area as previous CYRANO scene, but with only a chair. Barclay is sitting on it, not in costume but in character. Beverly is not in character, but is observing as instructor.
 Barclay is sipping from a glass at a table, studying a PADD. Troi steps over to his table, a cup of tea in hand.
 Holding near the Array.
 BROWER and Larson are waiting around the pool table as Geordi steps in with a PADD. Notices they're one short.

 Barclay is on a diagnostic bed, Beverly and Geordi standing next to him. Beverly is looking at the data displayed one the readout above the bed. She is stunned by what she finds.
 By the Array.
 Picard, Beverly, Geordi, Troi, and Riker.
 Barclay, Brower, and Larson are at their respective consoles, working as quickly as possible.
 Geordi glances at Picard, who nods his permission.
 Barclay, Larson and Brower at their respective control panels. Geordi is quickly moving between them and other stations, coordinating the work. It's damage control time.
 thinking out loud.
 La Forge to Bridge. We're looking at a cascade reactor failure on the Argus.
 Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, Ensign Anaya.
 As Picard considers the vast structure for a beat.
 Barclay is hurrying along the corridor, RED ALERT alarms blaring around him. He reaches a door marked HOLODECK THREE.
 Barclay steps quickly into the bare room.
 Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, Ensign Anaya. As the RED ALERT continues.
 Wasn't me, sir.
 Computer, how were the Argus reactors shut down?
 Barclay is in his chair, the two consoles around him. Hovering above is a massive half-globe shaped laser scanner that continuously plays tiny laser lights over Barclay's head. Conduits of all sizes and shapes lead away from the device to the walls of the holodeck, effectively wiring Barclay in.
 Motionless in space next to the Array.
 Picard, Riker, Geordi and Worf are staring at Barclay in his interface chair, the tiny lasers continuously scanning his head. His lips are not moving as he speaks. Red Alert has been cancelled.

 where the stars appear to be stretching away from the Enterprise.
 The ship hovering near the distortion.
 The door opens and Troi ENTERS. She is taken aback by the sight of Barclay all plugged in. As before, when he speaks, his mouth does not move.
 The RED ALERT SOUNDS. Geordi reacts.
 Troi is back on the Bridge. Data looks up from his console.
 The intense horizontal curvature of space is beginning to glow.
 No response. All are facing the viewscreen.
 as the ship begins to move slowly toward the distortion.
 The ship is inexorably heading towards the disturbance stretched.
 Mister Barclay! Respond at once!
 The door opens and Worf and TWO N. D. SECURITY MEN ENTER, phasers in hand.
 plugged into the interface. He seems to be in a higher state of consciousness... hardly acknowledges Worf's arrival. The ship suddenly SHAKES. Worf and his men steady themselves, then head quickly towards Barclay, BOUNCING OFF a force field directly in front of him. They quickly recover.
 The ship has been drawn into the 'tunnel'... the ship moves incredibly fast -- stars blur by at an extraordinary rate...
 SHAKING. The staff is holding on... watching the viewscreen. There is a change becoming apparent -- as everything on the Bridge, including personnel and voices, starts to distort. The effect continues through Scenes 92 and 96.
 Where all the star lines converge into one bright mass, which we approach at immense speed, until it engulfs the screen, and we burst through... with a WHITEOUT...
 Everything on the Bridge is suddenly normal. Everyone reacts.

 At impulse speed through normal space.
 Geordi, Troi, and Barclay are standing at the bar. Several couples and others dot the lounge, including two crew members playing three dimensional chess.
 The ship orbits a small, orange hued planet.
 PICARD, intensely studying his monitor screen.
 The door OPENS. Picard ENTERS looking somewhat fatigued.
 Vash, wearing the same outfit from the night before, and Picard, in his dress uniform, sit at a table eating a brekfast of rolls and jam. Though there is still a warm afterglow from the evening's activities, Picard is slightly ill at ease about playing host to Vash aboard the Enterprise.
 The lounge is only lightly populated at the moment.
 DATA and GEORDI at Science Station, WORF at Tactical. N.D.'s elsewhere.
 Data and Geordi. Geordi has also watched Vash EXIT the bridge.
 The ship maintains standard orbit.
 The reception. COUNCIL MEMBERS mingle with the crew. A rather informal time is being had by all.
 Vash has cornered TROI over by a buffet table.
 Vash passes by Worf, Geordi, Beverly and Data.
 Picard and the Vulcan.
 Riker at command. N.D.'s at Conn and Ops.
 Picard ENTERS and stops as he SEES --
 seated at his desk dressed in a Starfleet uniform.
 As before.
 Q is suddenly wearing a safari suit...
 Picard EXITS the turbolift. He heads down the Corridor on the way to meet with one of the Council Officials. At the hall he hesitates, turns left instead of right.
 Picard HALTS at a doorway. RINGS the bell.
 The first thing Picard notices are various digging tools piled in a corner. He looks over at Vash.
 A map of the ruins of Tagus.
 Picard places the Padd back on the table.
 Q's head APPEARS from the bulkhead behind her. He's obviously overheard their discussion and found it fascinating.
 As Troi, Geordi and Data walk down it...
 Leaning against a wall. Wearing a Starfleet uniform again.
 Picard ENTERS, disgruntled. He goes into his bedroom, which is dark. As he enters, he sees a figure under the covers in his bed. A slight smile creeps to his lips. He moves to the bed, pulls back the covers to reveal Q.
 As Picard and Riker ENTER...
 All seats are filled in anticipation of Picard's lecture. Vash sits among the Council Members. Our regular crew members are present as well.
 As he steps up to the podium. He's waited for this moment a long time.
 Suddenly, a hunting cap, with feather, appears on Beverly's head. As Troi attempts to point this phenomenon out to Beverly, a similar cap appears on her own head. They stare at each other in disbelief.
 Still unaware that anything is amiss.
 Riker reacts to the quarterstaff that appears in his hand; Geordi to the mandolin that appears in his.
 who finds himself wearing a cowl... and holding a leg of lamb.
 Astounded by the chaperone which has appeared on his shoulders.
 Picard, Riker, Geordi, Data, Worf, Beverly and Troi all APPEAR at the same time... all dressed in period costume. Beverly and Troi wear men's clothing. Beverly also carries a sword; Troi a longbow and arrows. Data is bald except for a soupbowl fringe plastered to his forehead. Riker wears a yellow jerkin and carries his quarterstaff. Worf is dressed like a dandy and Geordi still holds his madolin.
 As our heroes survey the scenery around them...
 Mounted on a sleek charger, sword drawn.
 Worf draws his own sword to defend his Captain...
 Sir Guy rides past Worf, cutting him across the shoulder with his sword. Worf is ready to fight on, but... Suddenly an arrow slams into a tree next to Picard...
 Coming over a nearby hill. Longbows at the ready.
 Three more arrows strike trees around them. Picard sees there's only one hope to escape.

 Hanging back as the others disappear into the trees.
 A furious Sir Guy turns to his men, who search the underbrush.
 Picard and his crew are resting. He approaches Worf who is being tended to by Beverly (sans tricorder.)
 Q appears on horseback. He's garbed in the cloak and livery of the High Sheriff of Nottingham.
 Establishing.
 A small, stark room in the tower; minimal furniture to include a wooden bench. Vash, dressed in Marian's virginal white, paces the floor. She's watched by an ELDERLY SERVANT.
 We hear bad mandolin playing in the background as Troi pulls back on a bow and lets fly an arrow. We HEAR the THWACK of impact. CAMERA PANS OVER to the tree that was her intended target. There's no sign of the arrow.
 Beverly is checking Worf's wound in the background as Geordi sits on a log strumming the mandolin... it sounds like fingernails on a blackboard.
 A relieved grin from Riker as he watches Picard buckle on his sword.
 Cold, imposing, and lit by flickering torches. We see a limited section of the yard... Heraldic banners hang from the walls. A circular staircase rises to the tower.
 Vash and Sir Guy, looking surprisingly chummy as they approach from another part of the courtyard. She carries a bouquet of fresh-picked flowers. Sir Guy holds up a pomegranate. Vash smiles and demurely nibbles it.
 Q crosses by the Tinker hammering at a chain. The Tinker looks up once Q has passed him by, REVEALING himself to be Picard in disguise.
 Vash paces around the room. Suddenly she stops. Listening to what could be a faint rustling. The noise ceases. Vash continues to pace. The rustling resumes, louder now. Again, Vash stops pacing. The sound, and now it's clearly the rustling of vines, is coming from outside her open window. She moves towards the embrasure, when SUDDENLY a hand APPEARS on the ledge. With a final GRUNT, Picard lifts himself through the window. Vash throws herself at him.
 Picard and the Guards come down the stairs. He barely glances at a beaming Q as he's hurried away. Sir Guy follows behind.
 Vash is seated at a table, writing feverishly. Her SERVANT ENTERS and scuttles across the room to her.
 A CROWD has gathered to SEE the show. Sir Guy and Q sit together at a dais at one end of the courtyard.

 A group of hooded monks have entered the courtyard. Beneath the hoods are Riker, Worf, Geordi, Data, Beverly and Troi.

 Picard comes face to face with Sir Guy.
 Gradually Picard forces Sir Guy up the stairs leading to Marian's room. Sir Guy, panic building, takes a vicious cut at Picard's head. Picard ducks, thrusts upward, and stabs Sir Guy through the body.
 Vash, listens to the SOUNDS of battle.
 The room is empty. Picard, in uniform, suddenly APPEARS at the podium. Riker and the others APPEAR back in the audience, exactly where they were sitting before. All back in their Starfleet uniforms. They look around in confusion.

 Picard ENTERS. As the doors CLOSE behind him Vash MATERIALIZES.
 Remind you of someone you know?
 A beat. Then a trace of a smile appears on his face.

 as seen in "The Defector." RIKER and TROI are questioning; WORF stands by the door. In the hot seat is a young Klingon civilian, J'DAN. He is wearing a Starfleet communicator.
 Worf and J'Dan ride in silence for a bit. J'Dan keeps sneaking looks at Worf, who stares straight ahead.
 The two proceed down a corridor.
 It could be done without any one knowing --
 as he follows Worf's exit with a vitriolic look.
 A Federation craft hovers near the Enterprise.
 PICARD and Riker watch as a group MATERIALIZES on the pad: SABIN GENESTRA, a Betazoid man; NELLEN TORE, a female assistant, and ADMIRAL NORAH SATIE, retired. She surveys the waiting group before her, finds Picard, and smiles radiantly. Norah Satie is middle-aged, a beautiful woman who has become more so with maturity. She is gracious, elegant, and decidedly feminine. Her smile is generous, bespeaking warmth and intelligence. She moves toward Picard, hand extended.
 Maybe the Admiral would like to see the visual log of the explosion.
 It is a video of the dilithium chamber... maybe a time code in the corner... MOS... they wait... wait... and then suddenly, the hatch to the chamber blows off and across the room.
 Worf ENTERS and approaches BEVERLY, who is examining a patient on a bio-bed. He is swathed in wraps which suggest burns. In the background is SIMON TARSES, a mild-looking humanoid working at a monitor.
 Worf indicates a small connection on the syringe.
 No... it's nothing we use...
 Picard and Satie. The briefing has been continuing for some time.
 Arranged to accommodate more questioners: Satie and Sabin, Picard and Worf. Off to one side sits Nellen, constantly taking notes. J'Dan is once again in the hot seat as Worf stands over him; they look like they've been at it a while.
 Picard with Norah. They have finished an informal supper; she rises and brings a tray of coffee things; during the next, she pours for them and twists a rind of lemon into her own. She looks lovely tonight... fragile and delicate, like a piece of porcelain. She is a woman who has the capacity to be both forceful and vulnerable.
 Worf showing Sabin the ship's roster...
 The same group -- Picard, Satie, Sabin, Worf -- are interviewing Beverly. Nellen is in the corner, taking notes.
 But Picard doesn't share the feelings of conquest. He is clearly uncomfortable with what has just happened.
 Picard and Satie.
 Data and Geordi, Picard and Satie. The isolation door is now up, though the dilithium chamber hatch is still missing.
 Picard, Satie, Worf, and Sabin. And Nellen, of course.
 Picard ENTERS to find Satie, Sabin, and Worf already seated at the front table; Tarses in the witness' seat, and next to him sits Riker.
 stunned by this development... and by the ugly turn he has seen take place in the conduct of this hearing.
 Picard exits a turbolift and almost immediately an Ensign, having exited the Observation Lounge, hurries along the corridor past him. Picard continues toward the Lounge when the doors open and another Ensign comes hurrying out and toward the turbolift. Picard pauses to look after him and right away another one comes out. Puzzled, Picard ENTERS the Observation Lounge.
 Picard ENTERS to find Worf there, at the head of the table; several crew members stand near him, carrying Padds.
 Picard carries tea to a seated Simon Tarses, who is almost as uneasy about a visit to the Captain's quarters as he is about his predicament.
 Satie and Nellen hurry along, the Admiral dictating and Nellen tapping furiously.
 Satie is staring at Picard as though he had gone mad.

 Picard sits in his chair, lost in a brown study.
 Now, there are more people in the gallery, including a greying Starfleet Admiral. At the head table are only Satie and Sabin. Worf is in the audience. And, in the hot seat -- Picard.
 He looks hard at Satie... uncomfortable... losing patience with this...
 As Satie strikes back at Picard.
 How dare you -- you who consort with Romulans... invoke my father's name to support your traitorous arguments... It is an offense... to everything I hold dear... to hear those words used to subvert the United Federation of Planets. My father was a great man... his name stands for principle, and integrity... you dirty that name by speaking it...
 Picard sits alone in the darkened room, staring out at the tableau of stars. Worf ENTERS, pauses, sensitive to Picard's somber mood.

 The ship moves into a synchronous orbit around a planet... Kaelon Two.
 The turbolift doors open, and PICARD emerges rather tentatively. Before taking a step, he looks both right and left to ensure the coast is clear. Over This:
 GEORDI waiting; O'BRIEN alongside his panel -- as Picard and the still-entwined Lwaxana ENTER.

 Geordi at his console, Timicin at another nearby, and SUPERNUMERARIES in attendance. They all react to...
 Very well. Mister Worf?
 In quick succession, ten photon torpedoes spew forth one by one.
 Worf responds to his board...
 As the torpedoes start to strike, we begin seeing the onset of the SECONDARY EXPLOSIONS.
 Geordi works at his console... Timicin at his.
 We see the massive PRIMARY EXPLOSION deep in the star's core... stirring its fiery red surface.
 Geordi reads off data as...
 Data makes his own report...
 Still rising. Ninety million degrees Kelvin... And now one hundred ten million. Looking good.
 Everyone reacts to...
 Geordi and Timicin are starting to feel very good... their confidence rising along with the temperature level on Praxillus.
 The star's turbulent surface is changing color... transforming from a bright red into a brilliant yellow as it shrinks in size by about thirty percent.
 Everyone is tense, but hopeful.
 An amazed Picard and Riker turn to the viewer... and the image of the revitalized, gleaming yellow star.
 All smiles here. An air of hope and celebration. When...
 Still with one eye on the monitor, his face suddenly deadens, with:

 Dark. Lwaxana, dressed in a man's robe, sits in a chair near the bed, staring at Timicin as he sleeps. He stirs, realizes she's not beside him, looks over and sees her watching him. He sits up. He is wearing pajamas.
 She goes to a food dispenser...
 As before.
 As Geordi and Data vainly study the monitors looking at test results, a thoughtful Timicin quietly observes... still considering what Lwaxana has told him.
 Picard sits working, as the Door Chime SOUNDS.

 Beverly is donning her jacket, stops in front of the mirror to run her fingers through her hair. Odan puts on a robe and comes up to her, putting his arms around her from behind. In the background, the bed is discreetly rumpled.
 Picard is already there, standing with LEKA, a representative of the Federation planet Peliar Zel, RIKER, TROI, and Data. Beverly ENTERS, nods toward Picard, who nods back, expressionless. She moves toward a seat next to Troi.

 The impact throws Odan from his seat; he strikes his head on the bulkhead and lands unconscious. Riker struggles to control the helm.
 The tractor beam has locked on to the shuttle. The other ship has turned and is headed once more to the moon.
 Captain, the shuttle hull has been weakened. We're breaking up... you can't tow us. Better beam us directly on board...

 Beverly and Odan; the nurse has departed.
 Beverly, drained and exhausted, sits at the table with Picard, Riker, Troi, Geordi and Worf. She has been recounting the bizarre tale, and the others listen quietly in various states of contained amazement.

 Beverly ENTERS, weary from the day's anxieties, wanting to unwind. She stretches her arms as she walks across the room, then drops her neck and rolls her head. She goes to the replicator.
 Riker paces, agitated.
 Beverly holds the rose in her hands, staring at it, as though in that way she could somehow leap back in time to that day when she was so happy... when all the universe was contained in Odan's eyes... She looks up... as though hearing something -- someone -- calling out to her...
 Riker is up, pacing, unable to sit still. He goes to the computer monitor, flips it on, stares at it, switches it off again. He goes to his replicator.

 Picard is almost unrecognizable when scanned through the VISOR'S all spectrum input -- the Romulan telemetry information visible as it focuses on him. The same effect that was established during the test on the Romulan holodeck appears here...

 You have done well, Commander. I thank you on behalf of the Empire.
 Riker is on the move... headed toward Data at an aft science station. Data studies a visual read-out on the monitor.

 Geordi sleeps fitfully... napping in his uniform. Slowly push in on the restless man -- who suddenly sits up with a gasp; eyes blinking, soaked in sweat. Geordi makes a sudden decision and keys his insignia:

 Data ENTERS and approaches Geordi's shuttlecraft.
 Worf and his security team are still at work in the background as O'Brien reports to Picard, Kell, and Vagh (who is flanked by his guards.) They stand near the bay's transporter console.
 Geordi is riding with another CREWMAN. After a moment, the lift stops, and the other man gets off.

 Final credits over black, no music.
 The ship is on the outskirts of a DARK MATTER NEBULA. This material is not normally visible to the eye, so all we should see at this point is a large black space devoid of stars hanging in front of the ship. Perhaps some nearby stars around the periphery of the nebula are partly obscured by the gaseous material, thus indicating that something is blocking our view.
 This is the torpedo operations center. Launch bays for torpedos are set into one of the bulkheads. DATA is working on a photon torpedo which has been slid out of one of the launch bays.
 Revealing ENSIGN JENNA D'SORA as she moves over to assist Data. Jenna is of Mediterranean descent, petite, and almost fragile in appearance. But her doll-like face belies the fact that she is a veteran security officer who could probably hold her own against anyone aboard ship. Emotionally, as we will learn, she is more fragile.
 Data closes the panel on the torpedo. Jenna moves to a control console on the bulkhead. Data gives everything one final check and then steps away from the torpedo and nods to Jenna. She works the controls and the torpedo SLIDES INTO the launch bay.
 RIKER in Command, ENSIGN MCKNIGHT at Con, WORF at Tactical.
 Data and Jenna are reading displays and working consoles. A SOUND EFFECT is heard and some lights FLASH to indicate the torpedo launch. A display monitor gives an EXTERIOR VIEW of the nebula outside the ship.
 The torpedo DISAPPEARS into the nebula. After a couple seconds, the torpedo EXPLODES and there is a BRILLIANT SHOW OF LIGHT. The dark matter has been illuminated by the display and the gaseous cloud can be seen clearly for the first time.
 Data and Jenna watch the monitor.
 A woodwind quintet composed of Data (oboe), Jenna (flute), KEIKO, (clarinet) and TWO N.D. MALE CREWMEMBERS (bassoon, French horn), is playing a piece of music to the patrons in the room, including O'BRIEN.
 A short time later. Data, Jenna, Keiko, and O'Brien are sitting at one of the tables, sharing drinks.
 The ship near the nebula.
 Data is at the aft science station, studying information from the nebula.
 The ship ENTERS the nebula at impulse.
 BEVERLY and a NURSE are standing at the large wall monitor, running a complex experiment.
 As she walks by a RACK OF INSTRUMENTS on the wall... Several steps past it she hears a glassy, metallic CLINK! She stops... looks back at the rack in puzzlement... then looks down at the floor.
 Revealing a MEDICAL INSTRUMENT lying on the deck beneath the rack. She's puzzled.
 Data and Jenna are working on an open photon torpedo. Jenna is installing a small cannister inside the central chamber of the torpedo. Data monitors with a small digital instrument. The work doesn't require their constant attention.
 It's after hours and the room is deserted. GUINAN is mixing several drinks in odd-shaped glasses on the bar. Data ENTERS, there is a lost, puzzled expression on his face.
 In the nebula.
 Data is about to go into his quarters. From o.s. we hear...
 Revealing GEORDI walking toward Data. He is carrying Data's CAT in his arms.
 Data puts the cat down.

 Data is painting at an easel. The door CHIMES.
 Jenna walks out of Data's quarters and the door closes behind her. She takes a few steps, still smiling, then pauses a moment. The smile fades for just an instant, replaced by the hint of a doubt about this situation. She walks back into her room... as a wall panel on the corridor bulkhead DEMATERIALIZES, briefly showing the wiring within.
 The ship in the nebula.
 Picard is working on a terminal at his desk.
 Picard steps onto the Bridge from the Ready Room. Riker is in Command, Data, Worf, McKnight at their respective positions.
 Nothing but the nebula and empty space.
 Picard, Riker, Worf, Data, and McKnight turn from the viewscreen.
 A reddish-brown planet now fills the screen. Everyone reacts to the sight.
 Picard and Riker exchange a bemused look.
 The door opens from the Bridge and Worf ENTERS first, phaser drawn. He is taken aback by what he sees.
 The entire room has been tossed. Everything not nailed down -- PADDS, chairs, displays -- looks as though it's been bounced off the walls.
 Everyone reacts.
 The Enterprise at impulse, nebula in the background.
 Data ENTERS, carrying a PADD under his arm like a briefcase, looking like a cross between Ward Cleaver and the Man in the Grey Flannel Suit. Jenna has just come in, is still in uniform, and looks a little frazzled.
 At full stop above the planet, the nebula dark in the background.
 Picard, Riker, Worf, and Data are at the aft science station.
 Geordi and several N.D. engineers, including THORNE and VAN MAYTER, are reading sensors.
 Everyone is alarmed.
 Everyone is tensed, hoping the full stop will lessen the strange dematerializations.
 Geordi is hurrying along with two Engineers.
 stuck half-way through the deck, at chest-level. Head, upper torso and one arm are all that's visible. He's limp, obviously dead.
 At full stop in the midst of the nebula.
 Picard, Riker, Worf and Geordi are sitting at the table. The atmosphere is one of grave concern. Data is standing next to an Okudagram displayed on the wall MONITOR.
 Picard, Riker, Data, and Worf enter the Bridge from the Observation Lounge. Jenna is standing at Tactical. Worf approaches her.
 heading across the Bridge. Riker starts to peel off toward the turbolift.
 The ship is in the nebula, the tiny shuttle far off in front of it. Both appear to be holding their positions.
 Picard at the console.
 Riker in captain's chair, Data at his post, Worf at Tactical, McKnight at CONN.
 in front of Picard, where there appears an OKUDAGRAM display, similar to the one Data had in the Observation Lounge, with "lines" of space displayed out in front of the shuttle. It resembles a vector graphic "POV" type videogame.
 Acknowledged, Captain. We're right behind you. Riker to O'Brien, lock on to the Captain's communicator. I want to be able to pull him out of there if I have to.
 The shuttle in f.g., Enterprise behind it in the nebula. As the shuttlecraft slowly moves forward, the Enterprise follows.
 Picard working controls, watching the monitor.
 the lines in space suddenly display a distorting
 New heading confirmed.
 Picard's eyes are glued on the monitor. Two pockets appear on the screen, a small one and a larger one.
 There is a jolt to the Bridge as the Enterprise makes the two corrections in close order.
 Three of the potholes appear on screen... There's not a minute for Picard to breathe. The potholes keep coming... big ones moving slowly, little ones that zip like hummingbirds. But this time there's a JOLT to the shuttle...
 There's an EFFECT on part of the shuttle... the thruster assembly flares, then hangs, damaged, on the shuttle.
 as the potholes keep coming... Picard tapping instructions... but...
 Sensors indicate damage to the shuttle's starboard impulse nacelle, Captain.
 Captain, I'm bringing you back.
 Where Picard is battling a bucking shuttle. Now he becomes a concert pianist... changing course to escape the oncoming potholes with one hand... working to correct the engine problem with the other.
 Deformation impact on Deck Fifteen... science section...
 Half a dozen pockets swarm toward the shuttle on the monitor. Picard barely has time to respond.
 continue their strange tandem dance through the nebula.
 Mister La Forge, I am still having difficulty controlling the shuttlecraft.
 Yes, sir, your krellide storage cells are losing their charge. Maintaining manual control is gonna get increasingly harder...
 The shuttle is bucking, barely under control.
 as the Bridge begins to jolt in response to the shuttle.
 I'm having trouble locking on, sir.
 Sir, the shuttle's inertial dampeners have failed. It is breaking up.
 The craft is spinning (SHAKING AS THE GASSY WHIRLS BLUR BY THE WINDOW). Picard can't even move from the g force.
 Riker and the others react to a tiny explosion far out in front of the ship -- it's the shuttle.
 As Picard MATERIALIZES, heads for the door.
 Acknowledged, sir.
 As the great ship plows toward the edge of the nebula... and then shoots out into normal space.
 as Picard emerges from the turbolift.
 The ship at warp in normal space.
 Data is preparing two place settings for an intimate dinner. His cat passes by. The door CHIMES.
 The ship at warp.
 WORF is practicing a form of martial art in front of a large mirror. He is dressed in a workout gi and is practicing a graceful and fluid kata using his bat'telth sword... he's been at this for a while and is disheveled and sweaty.
 That won't be necessary. I'm not here as your captain. I'm here as the person that stood with you before the High Council... your cha'DIch.
 The Enterprise and a Klingon attack cruiser running side by side on impulse power.
 RIKER and DATA at their positions. Picard ENTERS.
 GOWRON appears on the viewscreen, sitting in his ready room. Picard and Riker are surprised.
 Yes. In preventing a Klingon civil war.
 Picard is listening to Gowron. Gowron moves about the room... restless... a man being kept from what is rightfully his.
 I fail to see what I can do to assist...
 Picard and Gowron ENTER from the observation lounge. Riker, Worf, and DATA at their positions.
 Worf and Gowron ENTER. Gowron is studiously avoiding looking at Worf. As Gowron moves toward the platform, Worf finally decides to take the plunge.
 moving into orbit around the Klingon planet.
 As seen in "A Matter of Honor." CLOSE ON a phaser. MOVE TO REVEAL Worf checking his weapon on the phaser range. His expression is tense... tightly controlled. From o.s. we hear the SOUND OF DOORS OPENING and someone entering the range. Worf looks up in surprise to see...
 GUINAN steps into the small circle of light carrying a phaser.
 Picard at his desk. The door CHIMES.
 The ship in orbit around the Klingon Home World.
 Unlike its counterpart on the Enterprise, this room is designed to emphasize the prestige and prowess of the ship's captain. Weapons and trophies are boldly displayed on the wall and the captain's chair is bigger and higher than the other three seats. There is also a desk visible. KURN is sitting in the imposing captain's chair. The doors OPEN and WORF ENTERS. Kurn gets to his feet instantly... he's glad to see Worf.
 The Klingon capitol, with Great Hall in view.
 As seen in "Sins of the Father." THE COUNCIL MEMBERS are standing on either side of the leader's chair, which is empty except for the CEREMONIAL CLOAK OF K'MPEC. The Council Members are all male, predominantly older, with one or two young upstarts among them. There are TWO GUARDS in the room, standing watch at strategic points. Gowron and ONE AIDE stand nearby.
 Everyone turns to see TORAL, a Klingon boy (16-18), ENTER. He is a boy sent to do a man's job, and consequently he has all the arrogance and false bravado of youth instead of the confidence and strength of maturity.
 As before. MOVE AWAY from the Great Hall to another part of the city.
 The Klingon equivalent to the living room in a senator's house. There is a couch, a couple chairs, a low table, and some banners on the walls. It's dark... moody. Lursa and B'Etor are talking to someone o.s. while Toral sulks on the couch.
 Worf is talking to Kurn on the monitor.
 Starting on a transition shot of Data's hands quickly moving across the panels of the console... moving up to find Worf and Data at the aft science station.
 Picard and Worf ENTER. Picard takes a minute to compose his thoughts.
 As before.
 Picard ENTERS. Lursa and B'Etor are waiting for him. The low table is set with both Klingon and Human drinks. Their attitudes are relaxed... friendly.
 The Great Hall.
 The Council Members are assembled on the dais. Gowron, Lursa, B'Etor and Toral are standing off to the side while Picard stands in the center of the room.
 One by one, they step down from the dais and stand behind Toral until only K'tal and the other Councilor (who voted against him) are left.
 Lursa and B'Etor give Picard a final look: "see, I've still won."
 Showing the small group now standing alone in the vast and empty Great Hall.
 Gowron's ship in orbit, the Enterprise in b.g.
 Similar to the ready room on Kurn's ship, but with a few more symbols of Gowron's higher rank. Gowron is sitting in the captain's chair. The doors OPEN and Worf ENTERS. Gowron glares at him... he's a man in a tight spot and this had better be good.
 As a SUDDEN EXPLOSION ROCKS THE SHIP. Gowron and Worf are thrown about... the ship goes to the Klingon equivalent of RED ALERT.
 A BIRD OF PREY swoops in and attacks the cruiser.
 Gowron and Worf ENTER from the ready room. The bridge is manned by a WEAPONS OFFICER, HELMSMAN, ENGINEER, and FIRST OFFICER. The ship continues to SHAKE and ROCK as it takes hits from the other Klingon ships.
 Riker standing in command, Data at ops. Picard ENTERS from the turbolift.
 The ships attacking the Bortas.
 Picard looks at the viewscreen... his expression is grim.
 The ship fires disruptors.
 The ship is ROCKED with the impact of the shot.
 Everyone watching the viewscreen.
 The Enterprise turns and moves away from the other ship.
 Things are grim. Worf is trying to get his console to work... the bridge crew moves about quickly, attempting to get their crippled ship moving. Gowron and the First Officer are hunched over a monitor.
 The two ships moving along parallel courses.
 Worf reading his console... everyone else watching the viewscreen... they all know this is it.
 Disruptor fire hits the ship and it EXPLODES.
 As before.
 NEW ANGLE
 Kurn appears on the viewscreen.
 The Bird of Prey is moving toward the Bortas. Suddenly Kurn's ship swoops in and fires on the Bird of Prey... damaging it... the Bird of Prey moves away and cloaks....
 The enemy has sustained major damage to its life support systems... They have disengaged.
 Kurn nods and then the viewer returns to space.
 Picard, K'Tal, Gowron, and the supporting Council Member standing in their places exactly as in Scene 16. Kurn is standing off to the side while one of Gowron's Aides stands watch, holding a weapon. Picard is holding the cloak before Gowron and K'Tal is speaking the last few phrases of the installation ritual.
 Worf hand grabs the knife firmly by the blade... a couple drops of blood fall from his hand.
 Gowron and Worf still holding the knife.
 The ships in orbit.
 Picard, Riker, Gowron, and Worf.
 As he picks up the combadge...
 The two ships stationary in space.
 MOVE TO REVEAL Worf now wearing a KLINGON UNIFORM (which should incorporate his sash into the outfit). Most of his things are already packed and sitting on his bed. He looks around the room that has been his home for four years... Worf turns... sees his reflection in the mirror... looks himself over with curiosity... is this who he is? The door CHIMES.
 Picard ENTERS. It's a parallel scene to the beginning of the Teaser. As before, Picard's tone and manner are personal... intimate. These are two shipmates about to sail aboard different ships.
 The doors OPEN, revealing Worf and Picard. Worf takes a step... then stops in surprise.
 Revealing that the long, straight section of corridor leading from the turbolift to the transporter room is lined with CREWMEMBERS standing at parade rest. Picard is not surprised to see them.
 Worf and Picard ENTER through the open doors. At the end of the line are (in ascending order of rank) GEORDI, Data, TROI, BEVERLY, and Riker. Worf doesn't know what to say to these people... how to respond. They stand there silently... their respect and affection for their friend is clear... no words are necessary. Picard goes to the head of the line... Worf steps on the stage.
 After a beat...
 Worf DEMATERIALIZES. A silent beat...
 The Enterprise leaves and the Bortas remains in orbit.
 Movar is here, along with Lursa, B'Etor, and Toral. The Mysterious Woman heard from earlier is sitting in a chair with her back to us. Toral paces while the women study something on a monitor. The door OPENS and a ROMULAN CREWMEMBER ENTERS, carrying a PADD. The Crewmember hands the PADD to Movar, then EXITS. Movar studies it for a moment.
 The Woman turns around in her chair so that her features become apparent for the first time. We're shocked as we see that she's Human... with blonde hair... and that she bears a striking resemblance to the late Tasha Yar.
 Hold a beat on the starry blackness... suddenly a BIRD OF PREY comes tearing across the scene with DISRUPTOR FIRE bursting all around it from o.c. ships. The Bird of Prey takes a hit.
 The ship ROCKS with the hit. KURN in command, WORF at tactical, along with a HELMSMAN, and N.D. FIRST OFFICER, & ENGINEER at their stations. The bridge is smoky... a couple of consoles have blown out and there are one or two dead Klingons on the deck. The mood is tense and urgent.
 The Bird of Prey is being pursued by TWO KLINGON SHIPS. The Bird of Prey is heading directly for a star in the b.g.
 The ship is ROCKED AGAIN. The star looms larger and larger on the viewscreen.
 The Bird of Prey is heading directly into the star. Just as it is about to enter the star, the ship turns, goes into WARP SPEED, and heads away.
 They were following the Bird of Prey too closely. They try to turn away at the last second, but it's too late and they fly right into the blazing sun and are DESTROYED.
 Worf and the others have new respect for Kurn, who brought off this daring gamble.
 Hanging in space. A starbase is visible in the background.
 PICARD and RIKER are seated across the table from FLEET ADMIRAL SHANTHI and a N.D. STARFLEET ADMIRAL. Shanthi is the head of Starfleet, and is a woman of African descent in her late fifties with an almost regal bearing. She is listening to Picard while the N.D. Admiral looks on with disapproval.
 The ship in orbit near the starbase.
 Riker, DATA, and GEORDI are standing before Picard, who is studying some PADDs they've brought him. They contain lists of available ships.
 The Klingon Home World.
 If the Hell's Angels owned a posh country club, it would look something like this. The club is designed for food, drink, and merriment, Klingon-style. The room is filled with N.D. KLINGONS and the atmosphere is loud and raucous, with only a thin veneer of civility... like a controlled riot.
 As he ENTERS, carrying a PADD. In contrast to everyone else, he glowers around at the scene of revelry. A couple of Klingon women give him the eye as he passes, but his interest lies elsewhere. He finally spots Kurn sitting at a table with a Klingon captain named LARG. He moves toward them.
 Kurn and Larg are drinking and laughing loudly as Worf approaches.
 A different part of the club. LURSA and B'ETOR are sitting at a table, watching Worf with interest as he competes against another Klingon at the far table.
 A Nebula-class ship in spacedock.
 A smaller bridge than that of the Enterprise. N.D. CREWMEMBERS are hurrying around the bridge trying to get the ship ready to go. Panels and consoles are open, tools and boxes litter the floor and everything has a rushed, unready look to it. LT. COMMANDER HOBSON is berating some unfortunate N.D. ENGINEER just as Data ENTERS from the turbolift.
 Data is working the console as Hobson moves to him.
 O'BRIEN at tactical, N.D. CREWMEMBERS at ops and conn. Picard ENTERS from the ready room.
 The Enterprise leading the fleet out into deep space.
 The Klingon Home World.
 SELA (the Mysterious Woman from Part One) is arguing with B'Etor while MOVAR (the Romulan General) and TORAL (the Klingon boy) look on. Sela's attitude is crisp, dispassionate... very Romulan. B'Etor is very deferential to Sela... she clearly fears her.
 GOWRON is seated in the Leader's chair. Worf and Kurn stand before him. Kurn is holding a PADD. A Klingon named KULGE, and a couple N.D. KLINGONS are standing in the b.g. Kurn is finishing a report and Gowron is very unhappy.
 Picard in command, O'Brien at tactical, Troi next to Picard.
 The ship on impulse power.
 Data in command, Hobson moving back and forth between consoles, keeping an eye on things. Again, there should only be one or two N.D. CREWMEMBERS present. Ship's condition is YELLOW. Hobson is containing his resentment of Data for now -- but it's there, beneath the surface.
 Picard is at the aft science station watching two monitors. One screen shows a schematic display of the fleet, while the other shows Riker and Geordi on the bridge of the Excalibur.
 The screen at aft science station shows a schematic display of the fleet dispersed along the border. Suddenly, thousands of beams suddenly connect the ships of the fleet, forming a huge web.
 Captain, the tachyon network is active.
 The Romulan version of a ready room, it serves as more than a mere office. There are monitors and consoles which allow the commander to control the activities of the ship or of a fleet without actually being on the bridge. There is a single chair with a display console before it. Sela and Movar are watching one of the monitors which has a schematic display of the Federation fleet on it.
 O'Brien is watching his console.
 A WARBIRD DECLOAKS in front of the Enterprise.
 As before.
 The image of Sela comes on the screen.
 They are completely taken by surprise. Picard stares at this seeming ghost from the past.
 Continuous action. Picard still looking at Sela on the viewscreen.
 The two ships hanging in space.
 Picard, Troi, and BEVERLY.
 As he moves to the windows and looks out at the stars. Camera follows and closes on him. After a beat...
 As Picard turns to find GUINAN standing quietly at the door. Picard is a little surprised.
 The Klingon Home World.
 As seen before. The place is as rowdy and raucous as ever. Worf and Kurn are in deep discussion at a table.
 Including TWO KLINGONS who've been watching Kurn and Worf all this time. After Kurn leaves, they glance at each other and then move toward Worf. They move casually behind him... trying not to attract attention... then they try to jump Worf. There is a scuffle. Worf struggles gamely, but cannot overcome the two strongarms. They manage to overpower him, knocking him unconscious. They drag him out of the nightclub, and the crowd simply considers it an everyday occurence in the club.
 Picard is waiting near the windows. Sela and an N.D. SECURITY GUARD ENTER. Picard nods to the guard, who then EXITS. Sela immediately strides into the room, looking around, pacing like a jungle cat, covering the room as though marking territory. She is lithe, genial, confident -- and definitely going for the upper hand.
 He is unconscious. B'Etor moves into view... grabs a mouthful of Worf's hair... runs her fingernails across his cheek... makes a low, throaty sound. Worf slowly comes around... is almost turned on... then sits bolt upright as he realizes what's going on.
 Revealing Worf on a couch in the Duras home. B'Etor is all but on top of him, while Lursa looks on from a nearby chair.
 Sela appears on the screen.
 Picard talking to Gowron on the viewscreen.
 The two ships hanging in space.
 Picard and Riker are studying PADDs and displays on the desk.
 The Warbird hangs in space.
 Sela is looking at a console as Movar ENTERS.
 Picard in command, O'Brien at tactical. A beat as O'Brien reads his console.
 Sela and Movar watching a monitor. Sela waits for a long beat...
 The screen shows the schematic of the Federation fleet... suddenly one end portion of the tachyon field is disrupted by an intense surge of energy.
 As before.
 As before. There is an ALARM and O'Brien works his console quickly.
 The ship hangs in space.
 Data in command, Hobson at tactical. Hobson is reading a message on his console.
 As Hobson moves to join Data. Hobson peers at the information on the screen but it's moving by too rapidly for him to comprehend.
 as before.
 Hobson reads a message on the monitor.
 Begin sensor sweep, maximum range.
 The ship FIRES photon torpedoes.
 The torpedoes streak out at what seems to be empty space. They explode, and in so doing they illuminate THREE ROMULAN SHIPS. We can't actually see the ships, just the telltale tachyon signatures that surround them... the effect is similar to seeing several Christmas trees suddenly lit up in space.
 Movar and Sela watching a monitor in astonishment. The monitor shows the illuminated Romulan ships as seen above.
 As before. Data studies the tactical console with Hobson.
 The Home World.
 Toral is waiting nervously as Lursa and B'Etor ENTER, their faces grim. Toral looks to them for an answer. A glance between the sisters before B'Etor provides a simple explanation.
 The Romulan Guard seen earlier ENTERS with Worf. Worf looks like hell... they must have really worked him over because he can barely stand. Lursa looks him over quickly.
 The sisters don't care about Worf, the Guard, or Toral, they're bitter over the defeat and just want to get the hell out of here. Lursa pulls a small device from a pocket and activates it as Toral moves to join them, but he doesn't move quickly enough and the sisters DEMATERIALIZE in a transporter beam. Toral is shocked that they've left without him.
 The ship drops out of warp.
 Picard at his desk, looking over a report on his terminal.
 Gowron is in the leader's chair, and the KLINGON COUNCIL is now standing beside him. Picard stands before the Council. Gowron is looking at a Starfleet PADD.
 As Kurn and Worf ENTER. Worf looks much better than we last saw him, but there are still some scars visible, and he has a slight limp. Worf straightens at the sight of Picard, and the two men share a silent moment of reunion. But there is still other business to attend to...
 As a KLINGON GUARD ENTERS with Toral. The boy keeps his head up, determined to go out like a Klingon.
 He struggles... is this what being Klingon really means? Worf looks up at Picard, who is watching to see what he will do. Worf and Picard share a silent moment... Worf looks from the captain to the knife in his hand... finally drops the knife to the ground. A buzz of confusion goes around the room. Kurn moves quickly to his brother.
 Worf and Picard look at each other for a beat...
 Travelling at warp speed.
 PICARD, RIKER, TROI, DATA and WORF. The Enterprise is at warp. A schematic of a Tamarian spacecraft is displayed at Data's end of the table.
 A beat on the mysterious, powerful-looking vessel.
 The Enterprise and a Tamarian starship, as formidable as the graphic, slightly more robust than our own craft. The ships are facing each other, in orbit above a reddish planet.
 displays a TAMARIAN -- CAPTAIN DATHON -- flanked by his FIRST OFFICER, and TWO OTHER OFFICERS. Their uniforms are rich with insignia -- and each wears a small ceremonial dagger across his or her chest. But all look the very embodiment of "well-meaning."
 Picard, Riker, Troi, Worf. All are staring at the viewscreen, a stupefied expression on each face. Data cocks his head in the android equivalent.
 Now it's the Tamarians' turn to stare open-mouthed. They haven't a clue...
 Picard and Riker exchange a glance.
 Where the aliens appear to be having a spirited discussion amongst themselves.
 Picard watches as the alien captain turns to him -- now armed with two daggers.
 A desert filled with scrub-brush and rock. Picard and the Tamarian Captain are facing each other, separated by thirty feet of bare ground. Two daggers are in the alien's hands.
 and the Tamarian ship, facing each other in orbit above the planet.
 Riker, Data, Troi, Worf.
 Picard and the alien captain are still thirty feet apart, facing each other.
 Data looks up from his instruments. Riker is standing behind him, waiting for Data's report.
 The Tamarian First Officer in his chair, surrounded by his senior staff. All are grim-faced.

 not pleased with the situation.
 begins a strange ritual, alternately picking up one or more of the objects and dropping them on the ground, touching his forehead after each pattern formed by their fall. His manner is not particularly religious watches with curiosity. He rubs his arms unconsciously against the chill.
 The alien finishes his ritual, leaving the objects on the ground. He glances over at Picard -- who is walking back and forth, keeping his blood going. The Tamarian turns from him, laying down in front of the fire.
 closes his eyes, attempting to sleep. A couple of beats later, his eyes open. He rolls over, looks back at Picard.
 Picard isn't life-threatened by the cold -- but he looks increasingly uncomfortable. It's going to be a miserable night.
 He sighs -- with a hint of guilt. The alien sits up, pokes around the fire until he pulls out a branch burning at one end only.
 The Tamarian stands with the flame-tipped wood, and in one smooth motion, hurls it end over end across the clearing -- where it lands at Picard's feet.
 holds the brand to his pile of straw and it immediately ignites. He adds kindling and branches and quickly has a cheery fire. He looks back toward the alien.
 The Tamarian appears to be fast asleep.

 The BLAST rocks the shuttle. Worf and company nearly fall from their seats.
 Commander, the shuttle has been hit.
 The crew has recovered from the blast.
 Understood, Lieutenant. Return to the Enterprise.
 Worf plots a course.
 Riker turns to Data.
 The Tamarian ship.
 Riker, Data, Troi, GEORDI, Worf.
 Picard is curled up asleep by the now burned-out campfire. He takes a ragged breath, his eyes open. Picard sits up, takes in his surroundings, glances across the clearing.
 The alien's campsite is empty -- the Tamarian is nowhere to be seen.
 Picard stands, dusting himself off, still looking across the clearing.
 Two of the small pieces the Tamarian worked the ritual with the previous night. Picard's hand reaches down and picks one of them up.
 Picard turns it over in his hand, studying it. The object is metallic and crystalline, dull like lead rather than shining, but has a beauty nonetheless.
 belonging to the alien captain -- the same type of lettering on the Tamarian ship adorns its cover.
 They wait a moment.
 Picard is still standing ALONE in the alien's campsite. In his hands is the book, and he is pouring through it with great interest.
 A thin notebook of high-tech material. On its pages is a jumble of Tamarian writing, reminiscent of the lettering on the Tamarian ship. Picard's fingers carefully, respectfully turn the pages. The last entry ends in the middle of the page.
 A captain's log... ?
 Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra!
 Worf glances up in alarm from his post.
 Another ROAR -- and a strange low CRACKLING. Picard and the Tamarian both are facing toward the still unseen source. The alien turns to Picard, gravely offering him the dagger.
 La Forge and ENSIGN LEFLER are working quickly at their respective consoles.
 Riker and Worf look at each other -- the dynamic is more like two generals discussing strategy than a superior officer and his subordinate.
 O'BRIEN at his console.
 Riker, his face grim.
 The creature is now across the clearing, an almost imperceptible ripple in the air, a low electrical CRACKLING SOUND coming from it. Picard indicates they should retreat. The Tamarian shrugs him off -- as if he knows better.
 Geordi and Lefler at their consoles, working furiously.
 Riker and Worf.
 Geordi keeps working without missing a beat.
 O'Brien at the controls.

 The alien captain motions Picard away, indicating there should be more distance between them, using his hands to indicate the split.

 Picard's image begins to completely DEMATERIALIZE on the pad.
 Picard MATERIALIZES back into place, just in time to see the creature blur out and disappear in a crackling snarl, leaving the fallen Tamarian behind.
 Still facing each other.
 Data and Troi are waiting at the table. Geordi is sitting nearby.
 The Tamarian Captain is on the ground, lying on his back.

 The turbolift opens and Worf steps out onto the bridge. Riker turns to him as he heads for his post. Data and Troi are at their posts.

 Cruising at warp.
 Picard is at his terminal, engrossed. The door chimes.
 Close on PICARD in the barber chair, the barber's tools working on his hair. Picard's face is unpleasant as the BARBER chatters on.
 Sorry to interrupt. We're receiving an emergency distress signal from the Solarion Four colony.
 Uh oh, right along the Cardassian border...
 Picard ENTERS from the turbolift. RIKER, DATA, WORF and SUPERNUMERARIES on the bridge.
 At a space station.
 Close on ADMIRAL KENNELLY, standing. Kennelly is a younger man than Picard, more casual than your average Admiral. He's not feeling at all well; has a headache and a cold... the first thing he does when we cut to him is sneeze...
 Did the liaison have anything to say about the attack?
 Riker with A TRANSPORTER OFFICER (COLLINS).
 Riker says it with an edge. He knows who she is. And Picard also recognizes the name... reacts...
 Starting on a grim-faced Riker, clearly upset at this...
 The ship at warp.
 Close on Picard, who is with Riker. Picard is unhappy about all this.
 The ship comes out of warp.
 Picard, Riker, Data, TROI, Worf, BEVERLY, Ro. Data gives a mission update.
 As Picard, Data, Ro, Worf MATERIALIZE against a plain desert background... they begin to move forward into a new...
 to reveal the camp... and it is a devastating sight. A collection of several dozen ramshackle huts line the barren ground... built from bits and pieces of junk and wire and colored tarps... small chicken-like animals roam freely... clothes hang on lines that string the camp together...
 The children see them. Dirty, ill-clothed... they run to the exciting visitors... surround them with curiosity and hunger, touch their clothes, make an uproarious noise... Picard glances over and studies --
 as she looks at these young ones with warmth and pain and identification, and one three-year-old child who is stark naked looks at her... and she takes off her Starfleet jacket, kneels down and wraps it around the child. She catches the eye of Picard watching her and there is a vulnerability in her we haven't seen before as she simply explains...
 to reveal KEEVE FALOR chasing off all the children... he is a man in his forties, proud, honest, plain- speaking. Like all the Bajorans, he is dressed simply, and wears several silver earrings on both ears.
 Picard and Keeve walk together... Ro a step away. Data and Worf walk behind.
 Picard moves to take in this setting.

 Beverly and Troi ENTER, see Ro drinking alone at a table. They exchange a glance: "C'mon, let's do the right thing." They walk over... smile...
 Mid-conversation...
 as Guinan doesn't ask, she just sits down.
 As she ENTERS.
 In orbit of a moon.
 Picard and Riker on the move...
 Worf, Data and Troi are waiting for them. Collins, the Transporter Officer, is at the controls.
 A rocky, claustrophobic area... narrow passages go off in several directions.

 As they round a bend, Data and Troi see Picard and Worf... bound and gagged and at phaser point... Data and Troi react as more Bajorans terrorists appear from the shadows, moving up behind them... Troi and Data have no choice, they drop their phasers and allow themselves to be taken prisoner. And we:
 as before.
 ENTERS with a person whose face is shrouded. This is ORTA. He moves away from her to confront Picard... he speaks through a voice box that is implanted in the side of his neck... it is an eerily metallic sounding voice...
 In orbit around the moon.
 Riker is at command. The turbolift opens and the away team ENTERS in mid-conversation... Picard pointedly is not participating, moves slowly toward his ready room.
 Picard ENTERS, jaw tight, controlled... turns on a dime the moment they enter... eye to eye with Ro.
 Continuous action as she makes the long walk to the turbolift... avoiding eye contact with the others.
 Still in orbit of the moon.
 She lays on her bunk staring at the ceiling, tight... trying to find some answers... feeling humiliated... a door chime... she ignores it. Again.
 Picard at his desk studying his monitor... chime...
 Still in orbit around the moon.
 Kennelly is on the big screen. He still has his cold, and a hoarse throat. Picard, Riker, Worf, Data at their positions. Ro is at the conn.
 At impulse moving out of orbit...
 The Bajoran vessel is moving up from the surface, Captain.
 As it escorts the Bajoran ship at half impulse.
 I am monitoring increased activity inside Cardassian space... two ships are moving along the border... heading one-four-two mark zero-five-one...

 Picard and Ro walk...
 A lush and verdant world of hills, grasses, and wild flowers... no structures there yet, but flags and taped-off areas suggest buildings to come. Our people halcyon valley. A portable map table stands in the clearing; Riker and CARMEN DAVILA, an engineer with a keen mind and wry wit, inspect schematics of proposed structures.
 from their POV. Across the darkened sky a white spot of something is approaching -- at an incredible speed.
 stare at the object... Riker's face suddenly shows an awful recognition, a terrible disbelief.
 from Riker's POV the approaching object has taken form... a huge crystal form descending toward the planet... a vast shimmering, faceted shape... ominous in its cold beauty. The Crystalline Entity advances on the outpost.
 The wind is whipping now, and the SOUND is immense. A sense of urgency has overtaken the colonists, though they're trying not to panic. Riker, Beverly, Data, and Carmen are herding people together.
 on Beverly, herding people together.
 as he waves the colonists to follow Data.
 The Crystalline Entity now hovers above the outpost, a majestic and ominous form.
 A brilliant beam of light sweeps down from the Entity like a giant scythe, cutting a huge swath. The light encases everything in its path, suffuses it in the white-hot light... and then sweeps on. The tree and everything else in this arc of destruction is reduced to a pile of dust.

 Carmen!
 The ship is at warp, heading toward Melona.
 PICARD, WORF, TROI, ENSIGN at the conn, and SUPERNUMERARIES.
 Yes, sir. Something strange is going on... there are violent disruptions in the atmosphere...
 Riker is herding the last of the colonists into the caverns; behind him, the sound of the wind is fearful, and bursts of white light frequently illuminate him.
 Riker and Data at the entrance; Beverly and the others in b.g. as she does a cursory medical inspection.

 Some hours have passed. Everyone (except Data) is having trouble breathing now. They're warm, sweat-stained, clothing in disarray. The thumps are not heard now. Beverly moves toward Riker.

 Riker and a TRANSPORTER CHIEF wait, facing the platform.
 Picard, Riker, Data, Beverly, and Troi are at the table; Doctor Marr paces.
 Doctor Marr and SEVERAL TECHNICIANS roam the area with tricorders. Some of them collect samples of dust, etc. in (24th-century) glassine bags. Data ENTERS, carrying a tricorder. In spite of Doctor Marr's sublime indifference, he is gamely hanging in there, trying to do his job.
 Doctor Marr runs a tricorder around the walls of the cave.
 Doctor Marr, Geordi, and Data processing information.

 I'd heard that you had been programmed with the experiences of the colonists... but frankly it's a little hard to believe. Bridge.
 As it shows an OKUDAGRAM of graphs and figures.
 Riker, Troi, and Worf at their posts; Picard is with Data and Doctor Marr at an aft science station; supernumeraries as needed.
 Though surprised at Picard's position, Doctor Marr nonetheless retains the mien of a scientist pursuing the solution to a problem.
 Data is practicing a new instrument -- classical guitar. He cradles it correctly, reading from sheet music. The door CHIMES.
 The turbolift opens to discharge Data and Doctor Marr. Picard, Riker, Worf, and others as needed are on the bridge.

 Riker, Crusher, Data, Worf, and Doctor Marr emerge from the turbolift and make their report to Picard. (Geordi is at the aft science station.) Only Doctor Marr is silent, standing still and quiet to the side.

 Picard is at his desk; the door CHIMES.

 FADE IN:
 at warp.
 Picard, Riker, Troi, Worf; Data and Doctor Marr at an aft science station; Geordi at the other; supernumeraries.
 Nothing yet but the starfield. The crew on the bridge stare at it, rapt, waiting for the first indication that they have again encountered the mysterious Crystalline being. A beat. Still nothing... and then, a tiny white spot... approaching rapidly...
 looking at the screen. This is what she has been waiting to see for so many long, agonizing years.
 Shields up.
 The massive crystal, unable to withstand the pressures of the incredible forces set up within it, explodes in space. A brilliant burst of shards... scattering... disseminating... an awful radiance of destruction...
 The shock of what has happened is incredible. Picard turns toward the rear deck, his outrage restrained, but formidable.
 Doctor... if you will come with me...
 as Data and Marr ENTER.
 The ship is motionless in space.
 RIKER, DATA, and WORF are clustered around O'BRIEN and a pregnant KEIKO (about eight months along). O'Brien and Keiko have that proud-but-nervous look of expectant parents. While Data are Riker are very interested in Keiko's pregnancy, Worf looks exceptionally bored.
 BEVERLY is talking to GEORDI near a large stack of containers. This is a very large cargo bay and there is a door similar to the one in the shuttle bay that opens to space. This door is smaller and it is currently closed. The containers are marked
 LIEUTENANT MONROE at conn, ENSIGN MANDEL at ops. Troi is introducing three children to PICARD. The children are: MARISSA, a painfully shy nine-year-old who looks down at her shoes during the entire scene; JAY GORDON, a very solemn, serious boy who looks Picard right in the eye (he is a proper, polite boy who is eager to please, rather adult); and PATTERSON, a lively six- year-old with a winning smile and tons of energy. Picard is a little ill-at-ease here... this is not his favorite duty.
 The turbolift is MOVING. There is a beat of awkward silence as Picard and the kids look each other over.
 Beverly and Geordi are shaken violently...
 People react in alarm as tables, chairs, and glassware are shaken...
 The violent shaking STOPS and the bridge crew tries to sort things out for a moment. Lieutenant Monroe tries to take charge as she climbs to her feet near the conn.
 The Red Alert lights continue to blink on the darkened bridge. For a moment there is only the sound of crackling circuitry from the exploded conn console... then a few moans as people start to come to. O'Brien manages to stand and hit a button on one console... then the bridge is dimly illuminated by emergency lights. He helps Troi to her feet.
 O'Brien kneels and turns the body over; it's Monroe. He checks the arterial pulse, then shakes his head.
 As Mandel tries to key the panel next to the forward turbolift.
 CLOSE ON Picard. He's unconscious, lying on his right side with his right leg awkwardly folded underneath him. From o.c. we hear the sound of children softly crying. He begins to wake up and we MOVE TO REVEAL that he's still in the turbolift. There are a couple of emergency lights, but it's still pretty dark. Marissa, Jay Gordon, and Patterson are huddled together, watching Picard. Patterson is crying, Jay Gordon is silent and withdrawn, and Marissa is trembling.
 Troi and O'Brien are at the aft science station. The console is mostly blank except for one or two displays. Monroe's body has been moved off the bridge.
 As the doors part slowly to reveal ENSIGN RO. She is standing on the roof of a turbolift car that is stalled just below the bridge and she is slowly opening the doors by using an emergency hand crank.
 The ship is dead in space. There are only one or two lights visible on the entire ship.
 The place is littered with broken tables, overturned chairs, and smashed glassware. SEVERAL N.D. CREWMEMBERS are injured and being helped by Worf, who is carrying a medical tricorder and a first aid kit. Riker is dressing a head wound on Keiko, who is lying on the deck.
 As Data ENTERS (the doors do not slide open or closed. They are frozen halfway.) Riker motions to Worf and the three of them move across the room to speak privately.
 Geordi is working on an open panel and trying to open the door to the cargo bay. Beverly is standing nearby, watching his efforts.
 There is a PLASMA FIRE burning in the wall panel. It crackles and pops loudly, is bright green, and looks like a cross between molten lava and a chemical fire.
 As they watch the fire.
 Including the plasma fire, Geordi and Beverly, and the large number of quaratum containers.
 The ship still looks lifeless as it hangs in space.
 Picard is propped against a wall and reaching up to tinker with an open circuitry panel. Patterson is sitting with his knees to his chest, rocking back and forth; Jay Gordon is seated facing away from Picard. Only Marissa stands, gravely watching what he's doing.
 Riker and Data are crawling through a low, narrow tube just barely big enough for the two men to scramble through on their hands and knees. Riker stops and checks a nameplate on a box.
 A LARGE CLOUD OF GAS starts to swirl into the Jeffries Tube.
 Riker sees it too.
 Data and Riker hurry through the tube... the gas roiling behind them.
 There is a large display of ENERGY ARCING back and forth across the tube in front of Riker and Data. It completely blocks their path. Riker looks from the hatch with the gas behind it to the energy arc... they're trapped.
 Beverly is scanning the quaratum containers with a tricorder while Geordi works the transporter console. The plasma fire is o.c., but the green light can still be seen flickering in the bay. Beverly finishes her scan and moves to Geordi. She runs the tricorder over him.
 as it continues to pulsate and burn.
 Beverly looks around for a moment... then she walks over to the far wall and pulls out her tricorder.
 O'Brien and Troi are watching a console at the aft science station. There aren't many screens active, but the one they're watching is showing a complex pattern of shifting sensor readings. O'Brien taps a key and the display freezes.
 Ro is lying on her back, halfway inside the engineering station. Tools and equipment are strewn about next to her legs. O'Brien moves over and kneels down in concern. He tries to see what she's doing, but he can't. After a beat the engineering screen flickers ON... fades... then comes on permanently. Ro slides out of the console and gets to her feet.
 FADE IN:
 Riker and Data are still stuck between the closed hatch and the fluctuating power current. Data is peering inside a power relay box in the wall near the arcing power. He turns to Riker.
 As he turns and moves toward the arc. The power arc snaps and crackles ominously... Data waits a beat... then steps directly into the flow. There is a BRIGHT FLASH and THUNDERCLAP as the current hits Data's body. The energy holds him and shakes his body violently for a couple of seconds.
 As he turns away in response to the bright flash. After a beat, Riker turns back and then moves quickly to find Data lying face down in the tube. The power arc is gone, but Data's clothes and body have been seared and blackened.
 The ship hangs in space.
 Picard is standing on his good leg and is holding Jay Gordon up to the ceiling of the lift as Marissa helps to steady Picard. The effort of holding Jay Gordon is putting a tremendous strain on Picard. Jay puts his hands on the ceiling.
 Beverly and Geordi have moved all the containers against the far wall of the bay.
 They watch the fire for a beat.
 The room is filled with N.D. CASUALTIES. The tables and chairs have been moved out of the way to make room for injured crewmembers and civilians. TWO N.D. UNINJURED CREWMEMBERS are helping the injured. Keiko is finishing putting a dressing on a CREWMAN'S arm.
 As he prepares to put a splint on a MAN with a broken leg.
 Troi, Ro, and O'Brien at the table. Troi is listening quietly, absorbing the argument as the other two battle it out.
 The vertical shaft is very dark. There is a single ladder that runs the length of the shaft. Picard is on the ladder and is tied to Jay Gordon, Patterson and Marissa in turn by optical cables that have been fashioned into a safety rope. Picard is just below a door that has the words "DECK 7" in big letters (the turbolift was stuck on Deck 11). Picard is struggling with an open panel in an effort to open the doors, but it's very difficult to stay on the ladder and work the panel with all his weight on one leg.
 The shaft stretches seven stories above them. There are other hatches visible in the shaft.
 As before. There are looks of dismay from the children. Patterson looks like he's losing it again -- he's near tears.
 He hangs on to the ladder in terror as it SHAKES. The shaking STOPS after a moment, but Patterson continues to cling to the ladder for dear life and his eyes are shut tight with fear and his breathing is rapid.
 Including Picard and the other two children. He can't see Patterson from his angle.
 Keiko has been moved away from everyone else to provide some privacy and is propped up on some cushions. She is in a lot of pain and she's very sweaty and tired. Worf is kneeling next to her, holding a PADD. The first aid kit is nearby. Worf is way out of his element here, and he's uncomfortable.
 Geordi and Beverly are dragging the last container into place in front of the spacedoor. As Beverly talks, they set the container down, then move to the ladder and nearby console.
 The door OPENS. The blue outline of the pressurization field is visible around the door.
 They continue to hyperventilate... then both take a deep breath and hold it. Geordi presses one more control and then quickly wraps his arm back around the console.
 The blue outline DISAPPEARS from around the door and the bay DEPRESSURIZES. There is a ROAR OF AIR rushing out the door and the quaratum containers are BLOWN out of the door.
 They desperately hang on to the console as the wind rips past them. Suddenly the WIND STOPS as the bay is evacuated. (There should be NO SOUND HEARD from this point until the bay is repressurized.)
 The fire is SNUFFED OUT.
 Geordi frantically enters commands into the console and the spacedoor starts to slowly CLOSE.
 The pressure in their bodies are starting to affect them already. The door finally closes... Geordi & Beverly both move for the atmospheric control panel on the far wall... Geordi gets about halfway across the bay before becoming disoriented and dizzy... he falls to the floor in confusion.
 Beverly can barely focus her eyes at this point, but she manages to make it to the controls.
 The ship hangs in space.
 Troi in command, Ro at tactical, O'Brien at engineering, and Mandel at ops. Troi is under tremendous pressure; wrestling with the decision of whether or not to separate the ship, and holding the balance between O'Brien and Ro.
 There are several blown out panels in engineering and one or two dead bodies. The emergency isolation door has sealed the room off from the engine core. Riker is working on an open panel with a hand tool. He makes some final adjustment and then speaks to Data, who is o.c.
 Revealing that Riker is talking to Data's head, which has been placed on a drop-down panel. There are several optical fibers connecting his head to the wall panel and Data has been positioned so that he can look at one of the large screens on the table. Data as he quickly moves under the door and goes into Geordi's office. He is surprised that, in sharp contrast to the outer area, Geordi's office is completely powered up. Consoles are functioning and the normal lights are on. Riker moves to a monitor.
 There's no power on the entire deck, but somehow these monitors are working.
 O'Brien and Ro are at the monitors; Troi close by.
 The doors are pried open from the inside and an exhausted Picard hauls himself up and into the corridor. Marissa, Jay Gordon, and Patterson come up after him. Picard leans against the wall... he and the children smile at each other for a moment and then Marissa carefully gives him a hug. For once, Picard is not uncomfortable with the affection of children.
 Worf is still with Keiko. He studies the tricorder anxiously.
 The ship moving at warp speed.
 Troi, Marissa, Jay Gordon, and Patterson ENTER from the turbolift and go to Riker, who is in command. Data, Worf, and Ro are at their stations. Jay Gordon is carrying a plaque. (He is holding it against his chest with the lettering facing outward. It has been signed by the three children.) Riker stands and smiles at Troi as she approaches.
 The ship warping away.
 A plush bedroom suite, with a picturesque view of Risa through a large, open window. There are several platters of exotic-looking hors d'oeuvres around the room... not to mention an empty bottle of fine champagne.
 Two micro-thin LASERS emit from the arm extension and scan Riker's face, the lights gliding across his features. Quickly the lasers zero in on his eyes -- specifically, his pupils -- then vanish. This establishes a connection between Riker and the game.
 Riker reacts to something only he can see.
 We see Riker's view of his surroundings (the room, Etana), with a semi-translucent GAME OVERLAY superimposed on the scene. The overlay is an optical grid pattern, with a cone and a disc across it.
 At impulse.
 PICARD, DATA, WORF, and SUPERNUMERARIES at positions. VARIOUS CREWMEMBERS are working at the science stations. The bridge is alive with activity.
 It's a busy day. GEORDI and various ENGINEERING NDS are hard at work... including a striking young woman named ROBIN LEFLER, who's at an opened panel, organizing a pile of isolinear chips.
 Troi is sitting alone in a corner, contemplating a large and luscious chocolate fudge sundae.
 O'BRIEN at the controls. WESLEY CRUSHER MATERIALIZES on the transporter stage. He wears a Starfleet Academy Cadet uniform, and carries a travel bag. He looks a little more mature. At the sight of O'Brien, he smiles and steps down off the stage.
 The room is dark. The doors slide open and Wesley ENTERS. A beat, then the lights come on and several VOICES call out in greeting -- "Hello! Welcome home!"
 Picard, Riker, Data, Troi, Worf, Geordi and BEVERLY all in the room. A large cake sits on the table.
 On Beverly and Troi, conversing at the far end of the table. Beverly is looking at Troi with an intrigued expression.
 Data and Wesley ENTER the corridor and walk together...
 as the ship goes INTO WARP.
 The Engineering NDs are hard at work. Robin is absent. Geordi and Wesley are working at a control panel.
 Robin ENTERS, carrying some small equipment. As she crosses the room, she notices Wesley...
 looking frustrated, stuck on some sort of problem.
 Still a busy environment, with various supernumeraries tending to their work. Data ENTERS and goes to Geordi, who is at a science station.
 Beverly is working at a medical station. Data ENTERS.
 Riker and Troi ENTER from an adjoining room. Their faces are expressionless as they quickly move to Data. Without a word, they drag Data to a nearby examination table and lay him on top of it.
 At warp speed.
 Picard and Wesley sitting on the couch, talking. Picard is serving tea.
 Riker and Beverly are standing near a bio-bed, where Data is now laid out, unconscious. Picard and Geordi have joined the group. Geordi is examining an opened panel on Data's head. Riker and Beverly seem perfectly normal here -- even though we know they are lying.
 Geordi is busy at Data's work station. Riker stops behind him, holding a tricorder. They've been working a while, with little luck.
 Wesley and Robin together in Geordi's office, plugging isolinear chips into an opened control panel. They've been working a while -- and have relaxed around each other. Robin is easy-going... while Wesley is more serious. It makes for a playful dynamic.

 BEVERLY'S POV - THE GAME (OPTICAL)

 As the doors slide open and Wesley ENTERS looking rushed. He stops at the sight of his mother playing the game.
 as she is startled out of the game. She removes the headset, flushed and out of breath. And a little embarrassed at having been caught with the game.
 Wesley ENTERS, walks to a closet. Beverly follows, game in hand. She tries to engage him in a playful tone...

 Wesley starts to change his clothes. OFF his uneasy expression...
 Wesley and Robin at a table, immersed in dinner conversation...
 of a woman slipping the game onto her head. She leans back and starts to play the game...
 Wesley and Robin react.
 A small room with a single work table. Wesley and Robin are disassembling the game, which is propped up on a stand. They are connecting cables and sensors from the game's arm extension to a sensor pad. Clearly, this is fun for them.
 Picard is working at a terminal. The door CHIMES.

 FADE IN:
 A view of Ten Forward, with the game overlay visible. Hundreds of discs and cones crowd the playing grid... large numbers of discs dropping into cones all at once...
 O'Brien is the one playing the game. Standing near Robin's table, he half turns to Robin, absorbed in the game.
 Robin is peering out from around a corner in sickbay, trying to look inconspicuous. She's checking to see what the nurse is up to.
 of a NURSE standing in another part of sickbay -- he's wearing the game on his head, completely absorbed in playing it, oblivious to anything else.
 Robin watches a beat, then ducks back around the corner to where Data is laid out on a bio-bed, his head panel open, a diagnostic viewscreen nearby. Wesley is in the middle of examining the android with a medical tricorder.
 It shows a microscopic view of a complex network of positronic FIBERS -- some of which are clearly and cleanly cut.
 Coming to a stop near the Phoenix Cluster.
 Picard, Riker, Worf and Troi at their stations. Supernumeraries as needed. Beverly and Geordi are also present.
 The doors open -- Beverly and Worf ENTER, each carrying several of the games.
 Beverly and Worf ENTER, stop at what they see...
 sitting on the bed, both wearing the game on their heads. They look engrossed in the game... letting out tiny gasps of pleasure.
 A SMALL ALIEN SHIP pulls up to the Enterprise.
 Picard, Riker, Worf and Beverly at their positions.
 An alien woman appears -- it's Etana, the same woman from the Teaser. She studies the Enterprise crew.
 Continuous action. Picard and the bridge crew still looking at Etana on the viewscreen. In the background, Geordi and Troi ENTER, each carrying several of the games. They stop and watch the viewscreen.
 Wesley on the move, mock-up game in hand. He passes a crewperson, who glances at him. Wesley keeps a straight face, not stopping for a second...
 Wesley ENTERS. Two crewpeople are already in the lift. Wesley stands between them, trying to appear like nothing is out of the ordinary.
 As Wesley walks off, breathing a sigh of relief...
 Robin is at a work station. Various N.D.s in background. Wesley ENTERS, looking harried but determined. He goes straight to a console and sits down.
 Wesley bolts into the hall, closely followed by Riker and Worf.
 Wesley MATERIALIZES. He leaps down off the stage and races out the door...
 Wesley EXITS the transporter room and stops -- tears off his communicator, removes the front of it and tampers with the inside. Tossing the communicator to the floor, he takes off running down the corridor...
 Picard at command, Ensign Bloom at conn, Geordi at tactical. Troi and Beverly are at command.
 Wesley moving cautiously along. He stops at an intersection between two corridors and kneels down. He reaches into his pocket and reveals a TYPE-ONE PHASER (a smaller version of the regular phasers) and presses a command into it. He lays the phaser on the arm rail, aiming it at the intersection.... then activates it. The phaser sends out a series of weak, sporadic BURSTS -- the tiny beams absorbed harmlessly into the wall.
 As before.
 (Same one as before.) Wesley is gone. The phaser is still sending out the bursts when a FORCEFIELD appears at the intersection. The bursts start hitting the forcefield.
 Geordi reacts to the console.
 Wesley running along. He stops and peers around a corner. TWO SECURITY GUARDS are running toward him through the connecting corridor. Wesley ducks back around the corner. Waits. Looks again and the coast is clear. He makes a run into the corridor...
 The two security guards we've just seen arrive at the scene -- but Wesley is nowhere to be found. Just the phaser lying on the arm rail, sending out its tiny beams.
 Riker, Worf, and Robin at a console, trying to track Wesley. N.D.s working in background.
 Wesley is crawling horizontally along the narrow passageway, deep in the bowels of the ship. Suddenly, an access hatch opens behind him -- it's Worf. The Klingon starts after him. It's a tense chase down the crawlway until...
 in a part of the Jefferies Tube where Wesley can stand up (as seen in "Disaster"). He immediately presses a button next to the doors, and as they start to slide shut --
 The turbolift doors open and Riker and Worf ENTER, Wesley in tow between them -- they've each got an arm.
 The game sends out two thin LASERS -- and they make contact with Wesley's pupils. Wesley tenses up. The lasers vanish. Wesley's struggling starts to subside...

 Etana appears on the viewscreen, her outrage barely contained.
 The Enterprise at impulse speed. Several days have passed.
 Wesley standing at the bed, dressed in Academy uniform, packing his travel bag. Robin is beside him, handing him clothing. She holds up a pair of swimming trunks.
 Spock and Picard face each other as before. Data, Pardek, Romulan #1, and the other abductor witness the confrontation... Spock is not pleased to see anyone from Starfleet. With building conflict --
 Picard and Spock walk silently for a beat...
 Data, still in disguise, has just returned from the surface... Captain K'VADA reacts to the news with irritation... the Conn and Tactical Officers observe.

 So, what do you think of your enemy, Captain Picard?
 FADE IN:
 At the surplus yard. In orbit of Qualor Two.
 Close on an alien woman (AMARIE) at a keyboard... she must have been quite a looker once, but her best years are clearly behind her now. There's a bored, routine quality to her playing... aside from the fact that she has four arms. In one hand, she holds, not a cigarette, but a salt stick that she sucks on. She has a tip jar that has a few gold coins in it...
 It is bright. It is clean. It is metal and chrome and glass organized into high rises of various dynamic shapes.
 A stateliness, suggesting great power. Very clean lines, orderly, spacious... a Romulan chime at the door... an off-camera voice:
 Spock and Picard are sitting with members of the underground... Pardek at one side... D'Tan on the other... They are reacting to Spock's report of the meeting...
 Picard and Spock alone... Picard is angry...
 Small and dark... a single bed. Data, wearing his Starfleet uniform, is working on a computer... as the door opens and Picard and Spock ENTER... Spock immediately reacts...
 Amarie still at the piano, Worf sitting at the piano bar beside her... again, the room is lightly populated...
 to see the fattest Ferengi we've ever seen... on his arms, two gorgeous women in skintight dresses...
 as he exchanges a glance with Amarie who acknowledges, this is the guy... she begins to play a rhapsody... he hits his combadge...
 Riker in command...
 A colorful array of food is spread across the table in front of him... drinks and champagne... as he bangs on the table top with his shoe... mouth full of food...

 ADMIRAL BRACKETT, regal and poised as ever, with PICARD.
 A fuzzy, out-of-focus picture, with margins showing on screen, comes into frame -- something obviously taken on a very long lens. There are several blurred figures, none of them identifiable.
 Taken on Romulus, by long-range scanner. Computer, enhance image in section four-delta.

 coming out of warp.
 Moving along several PADDs spread out across the table... as well as other reports... clearly Picard has been doing a great deal of homework... but as we find him he is musing, staring out the window at the stars... Riker ENTERS...
 in orbit of Vulcan.
 Picard waits with a TRANSPORTER OFFICER as PERRIN MATERIALIZES on the pad. She walks forward, extending her arms, obviously glad to see Picard again. She is as lovely and gracious as ever, her eyes holding the only clue to the pain she carries from Sarek's illness.
 as they walk toward a turbolift.
 Picard is at the replicator, just removing two cups of tea. He gives her a cup of steaming tea and she takes it, inhaling the vapor.
 Riker and GEORDI stand looking over an unusual scene. Spread out on the floor of the bay are fragments of metal -- big, small, irregular, symmetrical, most of them charred and twisted beyond recognition. SUPERNUMERARIES, with tricorders, scanners, etc. are moving the fragments around, trying to arrange them into a cohesive pattern. In evidence are the broken remains of the containers which once housed the fragments.
 Sarek rests on a raised bed in an otherwise Spartan room. His head, resting on a pillow, is turned toward sunlight. Tears have coursed a pattern on his face and dried in rivulets. His mouth moves faintly, but no sound emerges. Perrin and Picard stand at the doorway, Picard noticeably shocked by this deterioration in Sarek's condition.
 Captain's log, stardate 45240.1. To cross the Neutral Zone, I will require a cloaked ship. To that end, I have set a course for the Klingon Home World. After all we did for Gowron during the recent war, I am certain he will be happy to return a favor.
 Close on Picard at tactical. On the heels of his confident log, Picard is uncharacteristically, well, flabbergasted...
 at an aft science station...
 The shot of Spock appears... another man who is with him... not at a good angle... is now recognizable as Pardek...
 One question answered. What do we know of him?
 Appearing on the viewscreen is a Klingon, B'IJIK -- the kind of small-minded person who basks in the reflected power of his superior, who has the authority to say "no," but never "yes."

 Picard and Data with Beverly. She is examining Data's ears with a 24th-century tech ear instrument... meanwhile a SUPERNUMERARY is coating one of Picard's ears with a plastic substance.
 Picard, Geordi, Riker, SUPERNUMERARIES as needed. The metal has been arranged into a pattern; some parts are still missing.
 Picard, Data, and the Klingon Captain, K'VADA. He is a burly man whose days of warrior glory are probably behind him; he's not thrilled about this assignment to ferry two wimp Starfleet officers across the Neutral Zone. He responds by being confrontational and challenging. During the next, Data wanders the bridge, scoping out the computer equipment.
 as the two great ships peel apart, each headed on its own precarious journey.
 at warp.
 The door to the quarters opens and K'vada ENTERS, followed by Picard and Data. A beat as he surveys the room. Then, with thinly veiled sarcasm --
 A bleak, uncomfortable room, Spartan in its furnishings; the bed is a shelf recessed in the wall; it is dark, dingy, and gives the impression of a place that has been unused for years.

 Riker, Worf, Troi, SUPERNUMERARIES.
 An alien civilian, DOKACHIN, appears on the screen.
 The Enterprise approaches a vast surplus depot of old, abandoned, and decommissioned vessels... stretching as far as the eye can see... a graveyard of once proud ships from throughout the Federation.
 Riker, Geordi, and Troi are standing at an aft science station as the turbolift opens and Worf and Dokachin ENTER. Dokachin scrutinizes the entire bridge. Riker is trying his hardest to be gracious.
 as it makes its way through the graveyard of ships.
 As before. Troi is seated near Dokachin, trying to keep a glazed expression off her face as Dokachin warms to his favorite subject.
 A starfield -- empty space. The group reacts with puzzlement; Dokachin is caught completely off guard. He takes a step toward the screen, nonplussed.

 If you do not respond to our hails, we will take that as evidence of hostile action.

 More shaking, lights going.

 Their forward shields are damaged, sir...
 On the stunned reactions of the bridge crew --
 as a hand reaches in and picks it up.
 Now we reveal Picard, also in Romulan garb and disguise. He begins to pack up the materials that have used to make the transformation - hyposprays, optical devices, etc.
 Picard and Data ENTER, and K'Vada, seeing them, bursts out laughing.
 Bright, metallic, clean... a linear arrangement of striking high-rise buildings.
 The same stately, elegant office seen in Part II. NERAL, the proconsul, works at a desk.
 This neighborhood is bleak, drab, severe. The people are joyless, grim, hurrying along without interacting with each other. There is the feeling that life is difficult here, and everyone pretty much looks out for himself.
 They move to stand, like others, at a table. A WOMAN appears before them... rather dour-looking, with hard, suspicious eyes.

 As the Enterprise enters orbit of a planet partially covered by huge dark clouds of dust.
 A city with eerie dark clouds above. It is snowing heavily.
 Meteorologist HAL MOSELEY's large cluttered office has been temporarily transformed into a crisis center. NUMEROUS N.D. SCIENTISTS move from one set of monitors to another. Picard and Geordi are beside Moseley. The snow can be seen through windows. Picard points to a map on a monitor.
 Rasmussen ENTERS holding a small pile of rectangular chips and looks around gleefully. He sees Riker, Worf, and Beverly at a table and heads over to join them.
 Geordi and an N.D. ENGINEER are at a console.

 Rasmussen walks by some crewmen and cheerfully nods. He goes to Data's door, rings the bell. The door opens and a bizarre cacophony of sounds almost overpowers him.
 Data is busy at his console.
 We open on CU of Picard. Data is there.

 Picard is staring out the window deep in thought. The door chimes.
 Picard ENTERS with Rasmussen following. Riker, Data, Worf, the Ensign and supernumeraries at their stations.

 Rasmussen almost can't control himself.

 Five parallel white beams shoot out from the deflector dish.

 (NOTE: The following sequence of opticals will take only ten-twelve seconds.) A thin orange beam fires parallel to the others.
 The phaser beam hits the spot where the other beams meet the cloud tops. A beat.
 as the blue energy beam makes contact, enveloping the ship.
 The bridge is vibrating and a huge roar is heard. Everyone is understandably tense.
 The blue light, which continues to envelop the planet below, is still being drawn to the Enterprise in the form of a thin beam, enveloping the ship, as well.
 The last reminders of the huge vibrations and noise echo into silence. All is still.
 the now cloudless planet is visible. A few smaller volcanic plumes can be seen.
 Picard looks to Riker and then to Data.

 in orbit around the planet.
 Rasmussen, his valise over a shoulder, ENTERS to find Picard, Beverly, Riker, Worf, and Data by his vessel. An N.D. SECURITY GUARD stands nearby.
 The vessel's interior, similar to its exterior, is truly futuristic, with multifaceted panels containing minimal blinkies. As Data ENTERS, he immediately notices two large collector trays.
 Picard, Beverly, Riker, Worf, and an N.D. Security guard, as before. The vessel door opens and Rasmussen exits, closely followed by Data, who now carries the phaser.
 in orbit of Penthara IV.
 The ship is entering orbit around a planet.
 GEORDI is working at a monitor in his office. He crosses to the pool table, where WORF and DATA are working. Geordi is very up, very excited. Data and Worf are their usual stoic selves.
 As Worf moves to a monitor and touches a button.
 A TRANSPORTER TECHNICIAN is behind the console. Worf is waiting by the platform. Helena and ALEXANDER MATERIALIZE on the platform. Helena gives Worf a big hug.
 Worf and Helena ENTER. They head for a private table near one of the windows.
 In orbit around Bilana Three.
 As they walk down the corridor, Worf tries to talk to Alexander in the easy, casual way he imagines other fathers do with their sons. Alexander's responses are not very engaging.
 A small, comfortable office decorated with children's drawings, toys, and games. The door CHIMES and MS. KYLE looks up from her desk. She is a caring and warm woman, yet her voice carries a ring of authority that unruly children would be unwise to challenge.
 Picard is sitting at his desk looking over a PADD in mild irritation. He sets it down... looks at the door... nothing happens... he picks up the PADD again. Finally the door CHIMES.
 The ship is still in orbit.
 PICARD, RIKER, Geordi, Data, and Worf are listening to DOCTOR JA'DAR. Dr. Ja'Dar is a middle-aged, humanoid alien who appears totally consumed by his work. Ja'Dar is pointing to the wall monitor upon which is a diagram of a SPACECRAFT in orbit around a PLANET.
 The SOLITON WAVE rises up from the planet and heads for the spacecraft. (The wave is represented by three small arcs tightly moving in a straight line.)
 If our theories are correct, the wave will envelop the ship and push it into warp.
 Picard, Riker, Data, and Worf ENTER from the observation lounge. TROI is at her station. She sees Worf and stands.
 As the group moves with Kyle, we find Worf and Alexander bringing up the rear of the group.
 There is a medium-sized tree with thick limbs and branches surrounded by rocks and a few short bushes inside the container, but there doesn't appear to be anything else. The children all gather at the window... even Alexander appears a little curious... but there still doesn't seem to be anything in the container. Kyle smiles and taps the glass.
 In response to the tapping on the glass, an EYE suddenly opens on one of the "branches" of the tree. The GILVO'S body looks like a long skinny piece of bark, and until it starts to move along the tree, it is virtually undetectable to the naked eye.
 The children are delighted and they press closer to the glass as ANOTHER GILVO starts to MOVE.
 turns to the nearby table and reaches for something... then frowns when it isn't there. She glances at Alexander, then recovers smoothly, as if there were nothing wrong.
 The group breaks up into father and son pairings and they move around the bay to explore the different displays and models. Alexander stays at the Gilvo container, fascinated by the gentle-looking creatures. Worf stands next to him, happy that Alexander has finally found something to attract his attention.
 As she quietly walks over to Alexander. She is being very discreet and nonthreatening in her attitude.
 As he steps forward.
 Worf pulls the model out of Alexander's pocket.
 As Worf realizes that his son has just lied to his face.
 The ship still in orbit around Bilana Three.
 Worf paces in the outer room, struggling to keep his anger below the surface. Alexander is seated, looking very small and vulnerable. Uncertain how to deal with this situation, Worf is seeking refuge in the familiar mantra of Klingon beliefs and values.
 As Worf lets his anger subside. Finally, he turns and speaks in a calm, assured manner.
 The ship in orbit.
 Worf is walking through the corridor, heading for a turbolift.
 Bridge.
 Riker, Geordi, and Data are at the aft science stations, Picard in command and ENSIGN FELTON is at the conn. Troi and Worf move to their own positions.
 Doctor Ja'Dar appears to be in a messy scientist's office. There is a computer terminal sitting on his desk.
 The SOLITON WAVE hits the SHIP, and the vehicle is quickly pushed into WARP SPEED.
 As before.
 The ship goes into warp.
 As before.
 The Test Ship is ahead of the Enterprise, traveling at warp speed. There should be a slight DISTORTION effect around the ship from the Soliton Wave.
 As before.
 The Soliton wave is very distant... suddenly the test ship EXPLODES. DISTORTION RIPPLES emanate from the explosion toward the Enterprise.
 As before. We are hit by the distortion and the ship is HEAVILY ROCKED. People are thrown to the deck and the LIGHTS GO OUT.
 The aftermath of the jolt. Order is being restored.
 Doctor Ja'Dar appears on the viewer. His visage is solemn.
 The ship hangs in space.
 Kyle is at her desk as Worf ENTERS.
 Worf angrily strides through the corridor and stops outside the holodeck doors. He presses the wall panel.
 As he ducks underneath the swinging blade of a large axe. WIDEN TO REVEAL...
 Worf's calisthenics program is running. (As seen in fighting the SKULL FACED ALIEN, seen in previous episodes, with Worf's bat'telh sword. Alexander is awkward and uncomfortable with the sword... it's really too big for him. The Alien swings the axe again... Alexander barely moves out of the way.
 As he finds Alexander in the holodeck. His anger at Alexander mixes with some pride as he sees what the boy is doing. Worf continues to watch discreetly with conflicting emotions as his son struggles with the fearsome Alien.
 The Alien isn't fighting at full speed, the program has slowed to match Alexander's lesser skill, but the boy is still having a hard time holding his own against the creature. Alexander trades thrusts and parries... gets knocked down... gets up for more.
 As the Alien VANISHES in response to the kill. Alexander steps back, breathing heavily. Worf nods in approval from the sidelines... then realizes why he's here in the first place.
 Riker in command, Data at the aft science station, Felton at the conn.
 FADE IN:
 Troi is sitting serenely in her chair as she calmly regards Worf, who is sitting on the couch facing her. He seems uncharacteristically restless, almost fidgety, and is clearly uncomfortable being here.
 The ship hangs in space.
 Alexander is violently stuffing his belongings into a suitcase with a great deal of anger. Worf ENTERS and watches him for a beat. He softens his approach... tries to make a genuine connection with the boy.
 Riker, Data, and Geordi at the table. Picard ENTERS and sits down.
 The ship goes into warp.
 Picard, Worf, Data, Riker, and Felton at their stations.
 The screen shows the WAVE out in front of the ship as it races through space. From this perspective, it appears as a large wavy distortion.
 As before.
 The ship begins gaining on the wave.
 The lab has been emptied of almost all the tables and displays seen earlier. Alexander moves to the large container and turns ON THE LIGHT. The two Gilvos OPEN THEIR EYES and look at him. Alexander smiles at the creatures. Suddenly, the ship is ROCKED and Alexander is thrown to the deck.
 The wave on the screen shifts COLORS and SHAPES as we try to punch through. The ship is ROCKED SEVERAL TIMES... then it stops.
 Which shows an Okudagram diagram of the Enterprise. There are several areas at the stern of the ship which have been highlighted.
 Make it so---
 Everyone is still reacting to the news of Alexander in the biolab. There is a sense of urgency.
 Geordi is working frantically in his office.
 Worf and Riker race down the corridor to the biolab door. Riker tries to work the panel outside the doors for a beat.
 Riker and Worf ENTER a room filled with FIRE and SMOKE. The doors CLOSE behind them and they struggle against the smoke and try to see through the haze. Keeping low to the ground, they move out in different directions.

 Returns with a long pole just as the beam clatters to the floor. He gives the heavy beam a quick look of surprise. As Worf bends down to pick up Alexander, the boy points at the container and cries out...
 As before.
 Riker and Worf (carrying the Gilvos and Alexander respectively) race through the burning lab, trying to get to the door...
 The ship FIRES torpedoes from the stern of the ship.
 Riker and Worf (still carrying the animals and the boy) burst out of the science lab. The doors CLOSE behind them. They sag against the wall, coughing and gasping for air.
 The torpedoes EXPLODE directly in front of the Soliton wave. The wave HITS the explosion, there is a large BURST OF ENERGY... then the wave dissipates.
 As before.
 Just outside the biolab. Riker is holding the two Gilvos in his arms while Worf and Alexander cling to each other. Picard is very relieved as Riker makes his report.
 The ship hanging in space.
 Alexander is lying on one of the beds. Worf stands beside the bed, watching carefully. BEVERLY is checking him over with a medical tricorder.

 Everyone reacts to the awesome spectacle. A huge, black bending of space, seemingly an immense lens-like cloud, dotted throughout by tiny pulsars -- miniature stars that blink on and off like lighthouses or fireflies.
 Everyone reacts to the sight.
 Riker, Data, and Geordi MATERIALIZE in a corridor-like chamber that has a couple of science consoles and small monitors against the wall. Data is carrying a small suitcase-sized, boxlike device. The corridor has been HEAVILY DAMAGED.

 Timothy looks up from the security of Data's shoulder, still in shock from the experience. He stares at the unfamiliar faces watching him. Timothy buries his head into Data's shoulder.
 The wrecked Vico hanging near the Enterprise.
 Timothy is on his back on a diagnostic bed, eyes open. His hand is still gripping Data's -- the boy clearly refuses to let go. Timothy has an edgy look in his eyes, bordering on panic. Beverly and Troi are standing next to Data.
 The away team's device is dumping its datastream into the computer console -- as before, the LASER makes the connection.

 Timothy is on his back in bed, eyes closed, having obviously just fallen asleep. Data takes a careful step back, joining Troi and Beverly, who are standing nearby.
 FADE IN:
 Geordi and Data are at their consoles.
 Alphanumeric bits of information flash by on the two screens. There appear to be major chunks of data missing -- blocks of blank space.
 This isn't good. I think whatever hit the Vico set up an E-M pulse that flashed through their computer banks.
 A TEACHER, male, late-twenties, is slowly walking past a beautiful painting of a multitiered, very alien-looking temple. He is carrying a PADD.

 Troi stops at Timothy's door and touches the panel -- we hear the CHIME. A few moments later, the door slides open, revealing Timothy.
 Troi and Timothy are sitting at a table.

 as Timothy looks at Data with tremendous admiration, then glances back at the mirror.
 Data and Timothy are striding along the corridor, in perfect step, their arms swinging in unison. It looks for all the world like there's a new android on board.

 Data and Timothy are sitting side by side with their legs hanging off the side of a diagnostic bed.
 Data and Timothy are each sitting at an easel, paint brush in hand, dabbing brushstrokes against their respective canvasses. Timothy's set-up is an exact duplicate. Data's painting is a tranquil landscape, we can't quite see what Timothy's working on...
 It looks exceedingly violent -- we can't actually see a spacecraft ripped apart, but we can sense the feeling of one. The boy's trauma is making its presence known...

 Geordi is at a console, inspecting a PADD that an N.D. ENGINEER has just handed him. The mood is relaxed -- like the end of a work shift.
 Approaching the console.
 Moving slowly at impulse speed toward the Black Cluster.
 Picard, Riker, Worf, Ensign Felton.
 Approaching the Black Cluster -- the dark warping of space looms even closer.
 Geordi is at the console. Another slight bump.
 A BUMP, then another -- much quieter -- then a third, barely felt, then nothing but smooth sailing.
 Seen through the observation window. The teacher is wandering in the background, helping out when needed. Timothy still looks like Data. The kids are working at a counter on a project, putting together a chemistry experiment -- some glassware and colored liquids.
 in the observation area, watching the scene. A boy makes a comment MOS and all the children laugh MOS -- including Timothy.
 Data and Timothy are sitting at a table. Timothy is drinking a brightly colored, frosty, soda-like drink. Data has a bubbly, different colored dessert drink in front of him. Timothy finishes a long sip.

 Picard, Troi and Data are still reacting to Timothy's revelation. Timothy speaks quietly, haltingly. He shivers, repressing sobs, as the agony of revealing his darkest secret emerges...

 Keiko sits at a table opposite a large, powerfully-built alien named TARMIN, 50's, whose eyes are closed as he concentrates on the same images as Keiko. Tarmin's hand touches his head. A white-haired female alien, INAD, quite a bit older than Tarmin, sits beside him. A third alien, JEV, Tarmin's attractive son, 30's, stands and observes. Also observing are RIKER, GEORDI, and BEVERLY, who seem to be fascinated by this process.

 An elegant dinner is being served to the Enterprise's guests of honor: Tarmin, the delegation leader, Inad, and Jev. PICARD, Riker, WORF, DATA, Geordi, TROI, and Beverly are present.
 Jev is standing outside a turbolift as Troi rounds the corner.

 She's lying on the floor, he's bending over her, faces close.

 Geordi -- I want to overwhelm him with evidence...
 A limited view of a yard... MARCUS BENBECK, a thin, studious man in his 50's is arguing with Conor.

 The group walks along the courtyard. Conor is cordial, outgoing. Benbeck is a stern, colorless man.
 HANNAH BATES is a vital young woman, about 30, bright, attractive, and inquisitive... working on Okudagrams regarding the fragment's path...
 Commander, if Mister Conor wouldn't object... I'd like to stay... and see more of his colony...
 Troi and Conor stroll the courtyard, examining the flowers and a few free-standing sculptures that are dotted about.

 Tied to the fragment as before. More frequent pulses.
 Four hundred percent over standard...
 At the conn, the ensign presses panels, taking readings... Suddenly a warning SOUNDS from the console... We begin to hear significant sound bumps and whines from the ship... hard move to Data as he reacts...
 Acknowledged.
 We have lost the second lateral emitter circuit...
 Hold on, Captain...
 The tractor beam retracts.
 Light levels resume normal intensity.
 Conor appears...

 She moves to a monitor and studies some schematics... after a beat, Geordi ENTERS...
 Picard, Riker, Geordi, Troi, BEVERLY, Worf. Geordi has just told the group about his conversation with Hannah.
 The door opens and Picard and Troi ENTER.
 Benbeck and Conor are with Hannah...
 Picard and Troi have entered...
 Troi, Hannah, Benbeck and dozens of other colonists wait for word from the summit meeting... finally Picard and Conor come out... Conor moves to address the crowd...
 Conor moves away... turning to Picard for a moment...

 Picard is at the window, looking out, musing. A chime...

 DATA and TROI are sitting at the bar, immersed in a game of three-dimensional chess. Data is clearly winning. He moves a piece, then waits as Troi contemplates the board. Troi moves a piece. Data reacts, puzzled.

 MACDUFF, a man in his late thirties, dressed in Starfleet Command uniform. We have never seen this man before now (he was not present before the flash of light), but he appears to be equally disoriented.
 Continuous action. Picard, Riker, Worf, Geordi, Ro and MacDuff are in a state of astonishment. They have all lost their memories (EXCEPT MACDUFF -- TO REVEAL LATER). It's a bizarre situation, the Enterprise crew suddenly strangers in a strange place. Everyone reacts to their obviously shared predicament.

 Worf, Picard, and MacDuff are gathered around a science station, watching Geordi work the controls. Riker and Ro EXIT the turbolift and approach.
 As the computer speaks, the MONITOR displays the identities of our characters one by one. A PHOTOGRAPH, name, rank, and brief biographical history all come up on the screen. It's a tantalizing process. Our crew watches with fascination as they each learn who they are...

 Picard, MacDuff, Riker, Data, Worf, Geordi, Troi and Ro seated around the table. Picard looks grave.
 At warp speed.
 Riker and Troi are walking along. Riker glances down at a PADD he's holding, then indicates a door -- they reach it and stop.
 Troi and Riker ENTER. They glance around. Troi starts to wander, taking in all the details. She runs a hand across the dresser... the bed... over some personal items on a table... as if by touching these things she will recall their significance.
 Riker walks toward a door. He stops and double-checks his PADD, then steps toward the door.
 Riker ENTERS, looks around. He walks further into the room, and stops at what he sees...

 Picard, MacDuff, Riker, Ro, Data and Beverly. Geordi is finishing his report.
 MacDuff is on his back in the half-shell bio-bed, his head couched by a headpiece apparatus. His eyes are closed -- as if he's unconscious. Beverly works the console next to the bed, and the series of lights flash on and off on the headpiece. A NURSE is working in the background.

 Approaches a MOON, which is cloaked with angry storm CLOUDS and LIGHTNING arcs of tremendous electrical activity. All silhouetted against a nearby massive, glowing gas-giant PLANET, the mother of this dark child.
 Picard and Riker are at Data's station... listening to an audio distress signal... puzzled... WORF is at tactical. ENSIGN RO is at the conn, and TROI ENTERS from the turbolift.

 With the storm activity down there, I don't think it's worth the risk to check on a ghost ship, Number One... advise Starfleet we've solved the mystery of Captain Shumar and the Essex...

 On RIKER, TROI and DATA, being buffeted inside on an instruments-only run, a rough-as-they-come flight. Over this, the distress SIGNAL mournfully plays, stronger.
 Picard at command.
 Riker and Co. struggle to keep their small, shaking craft aloft.
 CAMERA PANS through the murk, until we see the SHUTTLE. It's battered, sitting deadly still. More THUNDER booms, as LIGHTNING cracks. But no sign of life shows from inside the fallen craft.
 A flurry of activity. Our people are down there.
 On the shuttle. The hatch blows off and Riker emerges, holding his arm. Data and Troi follow, shook-up but intact. FOG swirls all around them, as distant thunderbolts brighten the scene: a BARREN LANDSCAPE with charred rocks and terrain, as if a forest fire has swept through the area. Dark and windy.
 to include distant GLIMMERING lights, seen ghostly through the fog and clouds. Dancing in the mist.
 On O'Brien and Geordi at the controls...
 The same conditions won't permit a shuttle to land safely, Mister LaForge... any suggestions... ?
 O'Brien touches the console, muting the transmission.
 His chances of getting down there safely are no better than fifty- fifty in my judgement...
 Prepare to transport.
 Riker rests, as Troi and Data survey the foggy area. O'Brien MATERIALIZES between them and the shuttle. Only to be greeted by more thunder and LIGHTNING.
 They hurriedly position three upright ENHANCER RODS around them to form a triangle. Thunder approaches. Data and O'Brien spread out... Riker goes with Troi...
 A spectacular system of LIGHTNING BOLTS explode, light up the sky. Followed by rolling THUNDER, inside angry, swirling CLOUDS. Within seconds, wind howling, thunder crashing, the STORM overtakes our away team.
 Mysterious ENERGY RINGS OF LIGHT suddenly appear, dive about like wavy alien fireflies. THREE RINGS eerily PULSE down onto Data, Troi and O'Brien... ANOTHER tries to approach Riker but is repelled somehow...
 Crawls up to O'Brien's enhancer rod, determined. And reaches out for the enhancer rod, throws the final switch. Three BEAMS OF BLUE LIGHT instantly turn on and connect - making a horizontal TRIANGLE OF LIGHT between the upright rods, which encloses them. Riker collapses.
 As they DEMATERIALIZE, HUMMING to feedback levels, as we gratefully:
 TIGHT on Troi, eyes closed, unconscious. WIDEN to BEVERLY who scans Troi on a table with a medical tricorder. A quiet moment goes by... Then without warning, Troi's EYES JERK OPEN and she BOLTS UPRIGHT, knocking aside equipment -- crying out in terror, as if awakened from a nightmare. Beverly's startled, and grasps Troi by the arms to keep her from struggling.
 It was just one hell of a storm... moved in on our position faster than anything I've ever seen.
 Did you find any evidence of life?
 As they exit... a quick beat as Data internally analyzes himself.
 Picard behind his desk, speaks to Troi, who is pacing nervously in front of the desk, arguing her point.
 As before. Ensign Ro reacts to her console, confused.
 ALERT sounding, Picard hurriedly moves to the door. But Troi blocks his way, throws out an arm to STRIKE Picard in the chest and knocks him down. Troi races out.
 Troi angrily ENTERS, looks around the bridge to Data. Riker, Ro and Worf are splayed out on the floor, as O'Brien robs the bridge locker for two more PHASERS. All is played on the move to the turbolift...
 Troi, Data, O'Brien stop. The doors slide shut.
 Riker, Worf, Ro and the N.D. all back on their feet, a little worse for wear. Picard groggily ENTERS. Security N.D.s RUSH IN.
 Troi, Data and O'Brien react as the turbolift abruptly STOPS. But the doors don't open. The three look at each other, all under an alien influence. Their movements bristling with great tension. Not happy alien campers.
 Worf reads his console.
 Worf and two Security N.D.s race up, stop at the turbolift. Worf hits a coding sequence, as the doors SLIDE OPEN to reveal: THREE COMMUNICATORS on the floor. OFF their reactions...
 Troi, Data, O'Brien move carefully down the hall. They encounter into a SECURITY FIELD - right behind them another appears. They are cut off, between fields.
 Riker at tactical -- he reacts to the console.
 A dozen CIVILIANS and CREWMEMBERS sit tight, calmly waiting out the Intruder Alert. All except one: BABY MOLLY, who's crying in KEIKO's arms. Keiko rocks her.
 Suddenly, the DOORS whoosh open -- as Troi, Data and O'Brien RUSH INSIDE, phasers drawn. Troi yells to all:
 Worf and TWO SECURITY N.D.s burst into the room, phasers ready. And they spread out, as the room shifts to them.
 Riker at tactical. NDs as needed. Picard's worried.
 Mister Worf... acknowledge.
 As Picard and Riker react, we anxiously:
 Picard and Riker at command. Ro has moved to tactical. Geordi's at ops. Supernumerary at the conn. Urgency is in the air.
 Attempting to lock on, sir...
 On Data and O'Brien at the computer terminal behind the bar... O'Brien working the controls with equal fervor...
 Bridge, the entire transporter array has been taken off-line and placed in a diagnostic mode... I can't override... it will take a couple of hours to complete the cycle...
 Troi has moved to the computer, where Data now works with lightning speed on the computer panels... O'Brien collects all the communicators from the hostages in Ten Forward.
 As before. Off console...
 (NOTE: INTERCUT all Bridge/Ten Forward exchanges as needed). Troi and O'Brien are relatively controlled. Data seems more nervous, waves a phaser aimed at the hostages.

 Move it where?
 Data stands at the row of windows, looking outside.
 Beverly moves over from the aft station... played with urgency --
 Troi glances toward the hostages -- sees the various crew and Security ND all lying unconscious on the floor. Other crew are looking after them, as best as possible.
 As before.
 Worf tries for a bit more information to the bridge.
 Picard turns to Riker. A troubled beat. Picard weighs his options, and makes a tough decision - not pleased, but knows it's necessary.
 Data looks nervous.
 Mixed reactions.
 The hostages are all now in the middle of the room, with Troi, Data, and O'Brien pacing anxiously around them. Baby Molly starts to CRY again, despite Keiko's efforts. Data throws an irritated glance toward the child.
 ENTERS, followed by MEDICAL N.D.'s with gurneys. Picard reacts to Data, who rips off Picard's communicator, grabs Picard's arm, and JERKS him into the room. The medical team moves directly to the wounded...
 takes a step toward Picard.
 As before. The medical team prepares the wounded for a quick exit, watched by Data and O'Brien. Picard faces Troi, startled by what he's just heard.
 Geordi and Ensign Ro crawl toward camera, in a small access area between decks, carrying their equipment.

 We're halfway home... La Forge to Crusher. How's it going?
 Riker is with Beverly at an aft station...
 Picard takes a seat next to Worf. They watch as Troi joins Data and the two of them begin a hushed conversation across the room. O'Brien acts as a sentry, pacing around the hostages. Picard whispers to Worf --
 as O'Brien comes out from behind the bar. He crosses to Keiko, who rocks Baby Molly. Keiko eyes O'Brien. After a beat, O'Brien moves closer, intrigued by a little bracelet that Keiko wears on her wrist.
 of the same scene... Troi, O'Brien and Data all within the central circle... but Data is always moving nervously in and out of the circle...
 Geordi working feverishly on a patched in computer panel... with great urgency --
 Riker and Beverly at the aft station...
 Geordi finishes his preparation...
 Data moves into the circle...
 An energy blast strikes Troi and O'Brien and they cower in pain as the energy rings streak out of them but Data wasn't hit.
 Damn... !
 Data grabs Picard roughly, moving quickly out of the line of fire... and holding him by the neck high up against a wall... holding a combadge between his thumb and forefinger in the other hand...
 Riker frowns...
 Ro and Geordi exchange a defeated glance...
 The entities return to Troi and O'Brien... Keiko has run back to her baby... Worf is on his feet, prepared for anything... Troi moves slowly over to Data, who is still holding Picard against the wall...
 In polar position beneath the angry storm moon.
 Riker at command. Ro at tactical. Beverly remains at an aft station. Geordi at ops. ND at the conn.
 Troi is with Data and O'Brien... Picard is with Worf near the other hostages...

 Riker reacts... doesn't want to... a beat... gambit...

 Ro angrily pushes back from the tactical station with frustration... her trick failed...
 O'Brien goes to work on the computer...
 As before. Riker at command.
 Troi holds a phaser to Picard, as Data/Worf and O'Brien/Keiko trail behind - all push by a security team, who stand at the sides, helpless to aid their captain and crewmates. The group ENTERS a turbolift.
 Mister La Forge, Doctor -- they'll be at their destination in less than a minute...
 As they enter. O'Brien goes immediately to the console, leaving Keiko at the side, as Troi/Picard and Data/Worf stand nearby. There's room aplenty inside the bay. And at the rear backside, the huge DOORS... that open out to space.
 They're powering up the transporter, Commander...
 O'Brien hits his panels... A large ENERGY CLOUD also MATERIALIZES -- alive with hundreds of diving, flying ENERGY RINGS (as in Act One). A powerful HUMMING takes over, as if inside a hive.
 They look as if they've waited a lifetime for this.
 You're quite right, Picard. We're not ghosts. And it is not rest, we seek. Only escape.
 Off tactical --
 Reactions as the TECH field fills the cargo bay... the energy rings are held in stasis, powerless...
 The rings emerge from Troi, Data and O'Brien... they each sag weakly to the floor while Data remains standing, still. Keiko rushes to O'Brien who has fallen unconscious.

 Close on Troi pulling back to reveal she is talking to Picard... in the background, Beverly runs some scans on O'Brien as Keiko holds Molly beside him... Data is completing some self-diagnostics with Worf near-by...
 As it leaves orbit of the stormy moon...
 In orbit around a planet.
 WORF and GEORDI are scanning some LARGE CARGO CONTAINERS with tricorders. There are other N.D. CREWMEMBERS in the b.g. checking the containers as well. The containers have been stacked in an intricate framework of metal support beams, pallettes, and lattices which reaches to the ceiling and almost completely fills the room.

 hears the RUMBLE from above and starts to move out of the way, but it's too late.
 as the heavy containers COLLAPSE on top of Worf.
 who turned around just in time to see the collapse.
 Worf is lying on his back with his eyes closed. He is dressed in a medical robe and is lying in one of the diagnostic beds. NURSE OGAWA is standing over Worf. After a beat, Worf moves slightly.
 The ship still in orbit.
 Worf has been moved to a private room just off main sickbay. There are several monitors, some medical equipment, and a diagnostic bed. Worf is sitting up in bed and has swung his legs over the side. His face is a mask of determination as he carefully grips the side of the bed and moves his feet down to the floor.
 As the doors OPEN and Beverly ENTERS. Worf wrenches his body as he tries to move his legs, but the effort causes him to lose his grip on the bed. Both legs fold under his weight... Beverly rushes over to him and catches him just in time. She helps him back into bed.
 The doors CLOSE behind Beverly after she ENTERS. She pauses for a moment, depressed and anguished over Worf's situation. She tries to shake off the feeling... picks up a PADD and starts to work it.
 The Enterprise and the Potemkin running side by side while still in orbit. (STOCK)
 Beverly is waiting near the platform as the TRANSPORTER TECHNICIAN works the console. DR. TOBY RUSSELL MATERIALIZES. Doctor Russell is petite and her features are delicate, doll-like. She has an easy and friendly manner, but she tends to command a room and is used to being center stage at any gathering. Russell has a knack for settling instantly into her environment, and she already seems very much at home.
 Russell and Beverly walk down the corridor. Russell has definitely turned on the charm.
 The ship in orbit.
 Worf is propped up in bed as RIKER ENTERS. Riker forces himself to smile at his friend and try to put him at ease.
 A room filled with medical equipment of every size and description. Beverly and Russell are standing near a large unit which is projecting a HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGE of Worf's back and spinal column in mid-air. Beverly is pointing to the damaged vertebrae, which have been highlighted.
 The ship goes into warp.
 PICARD, DATA, and Riker at their stations. Beverly ENTERS from a turbolift.
 The ship at warp.
 Riker is moving about the room... restless, clearly disturbed. Picard is calmly listening to his officer.
 TROI is trying to deal with a very angry ALEXANDER.
 Worf is lying in bed as he listens to Troi.
 Beverly moves to the monitor and activates the screen. A diagram of Worf's body comes up with SEVERAL IMPLANTS highlighted on the schematic.
 Beverly and Russell ENTER from Worf's sickbay room. Beverly turns and confronts Russell.
 Picard and Data are at the aft science station.
 Troi and Alexander ENTER. The boy is surprised to see Worf standing by the bed. Worf is wearing the motor assist bands on his legs and is standing very still with one hand clamped to a table for support.
 Looks up at his son and feels humiliated.
 The bay has been converted into an emergency hospital/triage center. The room is filled with a variety of medical equipment, diagnostic beds, gurneys, etc.
 Where we see Russell looking at an injured MAN who is lying on a diagnostic bed with a sheet over his head. Russell is running a scanner over his arm and then places the arm back on his chest. The man is dead. Russell goes to a monitor and studies an Okudagram.
 The ship in orbit.
 Worf is in bed as Beverly ENTERS. Her attitude is warm, cheerful... this is Beverly at her best, caring for a patient and trying to help him through a difficult time, but Worf isn't going to make this easy for her. His mind is obviously elsewhere.
 Beverly ENTERS and sits down at her desk. She's had a grueling couple of days and the previous scene with Worf has only added to the strain. She picks up a PADD and then tosses it back on the table in irritation.
 Riker is carrying a cup of tea and sitting down at his desk. He's been at this for a long time and he's tired. He takes a sip and then turns back to the computer terminal.
 The screen comes to life and shows a great deal of Klingon text.
 Riker continues reading the information on the screen... suddenly he sees something unexpected... and he begins to get an idea...
 Worf is lying in bed as Riker ENTERS. Riker is carrying a Klingon ceremonial robe, a knife, and other ceremonial objects. He puts them on the bed. Worf reacts with surprise for a moment... he hadn't expected Riker so soon. But he quickly composes himself and then speaks with great formality.
 The ship at warp.
 I must still undergo a dangerous operation. I may still die. But it will not be by my own hand.
 The ship at warp.
 Worf is lying in bed, listening to Alexander as Troi looks on.
 The ship moving at warp speed.
 The scene is similar to the one we saw earlier in the holodeck, but there is more tension present. Beverly and Ogawa are assisting Russell in the procedure. Everyone is wearing surgical gowns and masks. The surgical clamshell is in place over Worf's back. All the medical talk during surgery should be short and clipped... no time for wasted words or actions here.
 Picard and Riker are looking over some reports on a couple of PADDs, but it's clear that there's something else on both their minds.
 Russell and Beverly are working at the genetronic machine seen earlier. Worf's entire SPINAL COLUMN has been placed on the genetronic device and the gleaming white of the bone is in stark contrast to the dark surfaces of the machine. Ogawa is standing near Worf's unconscious form in the b.g., monitoring his signs.
 Troi and Alexander are sitting on the couch. He's halfheartedly playing with some game, but his mind is clearly elsewhere. Troi puts her arm around him and Alexander accepts the comforting gesture.
 Russell is standing near the genetronic machine while Beverly and Ogawa wait near Worf's body.
 which has a SMALL CLEAR BOX sitting on the machine next to Worf's spinal column. We can see a long, thin piece of tissue which looks like fettucini, floating in some clear liquid in the box.
 Ogawa takes the clear box from the machine and carefully takes it over to the table and sets it down on a nearby cart.
 The monitor screen on the clamshell shows a schematic view of Worf's back and torso. As they work, a new spinal column and cord begins to GROW on the monitor. The effect is similar to watching time-lapse photography of plants or crystals being grown as the bone and nerve endings begin to take form in Worf's back.
 As they watch the screen.
 Troi is still on the couch... Alexander has fallen asleep in her lap. She strokes the boy's hair for a moment... now that she doesn't have to put up a brave front, we can see the anxiety Troi is actually feeling.
 Beverly and Russell are still watching the clamshell monitor. Ogawa's attention is focused on a monitor. The atmosphere is tense and urgent.
 Troi and Alexander are still on the couch as Beverly ENTERS, exchanges a look with Troi.
 Beverly, Ogawa, Russell, and Troi watch as Alexander bravely walks over to his father's body, which is still lying on the surgical table. Russell watches, helplessly, in a room where only moments ago she was confident and clearly in charge. Alexander is trying to hold back his tears... to behave like his father would have wanted... he puts his hands on Worf's head... manfully throws back his head and tries to yell a Klingon howl at the ceiling... but his voice breaks and the shout of defiance breaks into a sob and the tears finally begin to roll down his face.
 Worf's still form on the table... suddenly his neck stiffens, chin snaps back slightly and he takes in a quick, shallow breath... holds it for a beat... then releases it.
 takes a moment to realize what's happening, then she reacts and races over to Worf.
 The ship in orbit around the planet seen in the Teaser.
 Beverly is at her desk as Russell ENTERS from sickbay. Russell's attitude is light and pleasant.
 The ship leaves orbit and goes into warp.
 Worf is standing between two parallel bars which are at waist level. Some of his weight is on his arms, which are tightly gripping the bars, but he is making good progress as he tries to walk. Troi, Beverly, and Alexander stand off to one side and watch.
 Steadies himself again... he looks at Alexander for a moment... sees the look of concern and helplessness on the boy's face. Worf thinks for a few seconds and then turns to Troi.

 PICARD, RIKER, WORF, DATA, SUPERNUMERARIES, and several J'naii, including SOREN and KRITE. The J'naii are a genderless species; Soren and Krite, like the others, possess no demonstrable sexual characteristics. All the J'naii look remarkably alike: strikingly attractive, with lithe, slim bodies and chiseled, delicate features. Soren is near Riker; Krite at an aft station.
 It shows the starfield -- no sign of a shuttlecraft.

 Riker, Soren, Krite, NOOR (head of government), and other J'naii leaders are gathered to discuss the situation. The room is not huge -- just larger than the observation lounge.
 Riker and Soren walk around the shuttlecraft.
 They sit at the controls.
 The monitor on the panel jumps to life, scrolling through a systems review.
 Propulsion system... transfer conduits... where's the schematic of the reactor assembly? Oh, there it is... engine nacelles...

 Troi sits on her couch, inspecting the contents of a box which rests on the floor. There are several artifacts spread out on a coffee table -- small figures, a doll, pictures, little books, etc. Troi holds a larger book on her lap and is leafing through the pages. The door CHIMES.
 Riker and Soren work with Geordi; Krite and another J'naii are in the background, monitoring a console. Riker and Soren are in their formal mode.

 Riker walks the corridor toward Soren's quarters, finds the right one, presses the panel. The door opens to reveal Krite. Riker is surprised.
 Soren sits before a panel of "judges," including Noor. A gallery of citizens fills the room.
 Continuous action. Soren has just make her declaration. Riker stares at her, knowing she has fully incriminated herself. Noor is regarding Soren with impersonal objectivity.

 Riker has finished telling the story to Picard, who has taken it all in and is reflecting on it now.
 Riker, still in uniform, is assembling some equipment The door CHIMES again.
 The courtyard/garden. Riker, now dressed in N.D. dark clothing, is positioned in the woods, watching toward the civic center. The building is lit, and there is activity inside. Worf, also in dark clothing, comes up to him through the trees.

 Later. Beverly is dressed in her nightclothes, ready for bed. She passes by a table topped with several exotic PLANTS, picks up a cutting tool and starts to snip away the dead leaves. As she does so, she quietly sings a little song, letting herself unwind. After a peaceful beat, she puts down the tool, and heads for bed...
 Beverly sits down, reaches for a GLASS of water off the night stand and takes a sip. She turns off the lamp and the room darkens. She crawls under the covers, lays her head on the pillow. A quiet moment passes as Beverly drifts off to sleep...

 Picard, Riker, Data, Geordi, Troi, and Beverly. Geordi is standing next to a WALL MONITOR, which displays a MAP of the TYPHON EXPANSE. They are wrapping up a discussion about their mission.
 Picard and the others ENTER the bridge, take stations. Riker stands near Data, at ops.
 The area of space just ahead is MURKY and DISTORTED. Reactions to the sight.
 A STARSHIP EMERGES from the murk -- HEADED DIRECTLY FOR US. (Note: It's clearly an older style starship.) The following action happens quickly --
 The Enterprise sends out a TRACTOR BEAM -- but it's too late. The other ship COLLIDES with our starboard nacelle, knocking us aside. The Enterprise's starboard nacelle is DAMAGED, sending out stray jets of plasma...

 Beverly sits down, picks up the glass of water and takes a sip. She stares at the glass, deja-vu nagging at her -- is something going to happen to the glass? She sets down the glass, turns off the lamp, crawls under the covers... tries to sleep...
 Beverly, tired after a long night, sits with Picard in the dimly lit, comforting room. She has been recounting recent events. Picard hands her a cup of steaming liquid.

 Beverly sits down, picks up the glass of water from the night stand and takes a sip. She stares at the glass with dread certainty -- the glass is going to break.
 Beverly watches as Geordi and Data analyze a console. They are listening to the RECORDING Beverly made -- a cacophony of VOICES which is muddled by static and noise. The sound stops.

 Picard relaxing in a chair, reading a leather-bound book (the same book seen in Act Two). A quiet moment as he reads... then pauses. A feeling of Deja-vu washes over him -- has he read this book before? He glances at the book title, flips through the pages a few times. Strange...
 Picard listening to Beverly and Geordi, near the optical diagnostic instrument (as seen in Act Three). Mid-conversation...
 Later. Geordi and Data working at the consoles, analyzing the ship's sensors.
 Numbers begin to appear on the screen:
 Geordi looks at the monitor.

 Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, Geordi, Beverly and Troi. They are listening to the recording of the VOICES -- the segments that Data isolated in Act Four. The wall monitor shows the causality loop diagram. The mood is tense -- they are in the middle of discussing their causality loop...
 Picard and the others ENTER and take stations. Riker stands near Data, at ops.
 The area of space just ahead is MURKY and DISTORTED. Picard and Riker exchange a glance.

 Beverly and Picard are seated across from each other. Beverly is trying to stay calm; she is quiet and subdued, but there's an edge in her voice. She's concentrating on the medical angle for now... trying not to let her emotions show through.
 in orbit around Earth.
 Est. shot of the Starfleet Academy campus. A large, sprawling campus in the San Francisco Bay Area.
 This is one of the oldest buildings in the Academy, and a powerful sense of tradition pervades it. The room is probably used for both hearings and lectures. There are several tables, on the right wall is a large viewscreen, and several rows of benches form a gallery.
 as the meeting breaks up. Picard moves to Brand and they shake hands.
 as Beverly approaches Lt. Commander Albert. He is quiet and shaken.
 In contrast to quarters on the Enterprise, the Academy dorm room looks older and more lived-in. It's sparsely furnished with a desk, a couple of chairs, and a single bed. Everything is neat and ship-shape.
 The grounds of the Academy are similar to any large university: Neatly manicured lawn and hedges, one or two statues or busts of alumni, possibly a fountain, etc. SEVERAL CADETS can be seen moving to and from class or talking in small groups... there is a somber atmosphere here as the recent tragedy is still on everyone's mind. In the distance, the Federation flag can be seen at half-mast on a flagpole. Picard is walking slowly across the grounds, lost in thought...
 As Picard comes to a quiet contemplative spot with a view of the rest of the grounds. There is a large TREE here with a couple of nearby benches. Sitting at the foot of that tree (not on a bench) is a young MALE CADET reading a book. It's a picture-perfect image that is almost pastoral.

 as Boothby shakes his head with disdain and kneels down and begins to repair the damaged plants... Picard quietly moves over to the tree...
 is walking along the path. He suddenly freezes in his tracks and reacts as he sees a Starfleet captain on his knees with the gardener...
 Boothby -- who knew Picard when he was just a cadet -- is faintly amused by the lofty status he's now achieved.
 Wesley, Locarno, Sito, and Hajar (as described in scene three as they stand at loose attention. Locarno is a coach here, not a martinet... he's building them up, getting them ready for some tough times ahead.
 The room has been set up for an informal court of inquiry.
 The monitor ZOOMS close on the graphic symbols for the ships as they change formation... four ships move into position as four "points" of a diamond, while one ship slides into the middle "slot" position. Each ship is clearly labeled by pilot: Locarno in the lead, Hajar in the slot, Wesley and Albert on either wing, and Sito in the rear.
 Remaining in the diamond formation, we executed a low apogee turn around Titan... then began a z plus twenty-five degree climb in preparation for a Yeager loop.
 As they watch the proceedings. Picard is paying very close attention to the testimony and the computer simulation. Beverly is also watching carefully, but she can't help but glance at Wesley every now and then.
 The ships on the monitor begin to turn in an intricate looping maneuver.
 We had less than two seconds to activate our emergency transporters and beam to the evac station on Mimas. Everyone made it... except Josh.
 He frowns at this litany of denial. Something here isn't making sense.
 Satelk turns his gaze to Sito. Sito returns the gaze, but we sense that inside she's uncomfortable.
 Beverly turns to Picard with concern.
 As Brand looks at Sito.
 He's shocked by what Locarno's just said -- but keeps it inside. The other two cadets trade nervous glances, but try not to let their anxiety show.
 Lt. Cmdr. Albert is shaken by Locarno's statement... it's a hard thing to hear about your own son.
 Picard is disturbed... not quite sure what to make of this new piece of information.
 Please be seated.
 They stand up and Wesley turns to face Locarno. Locarno is cool... he smiles confidently.
 The ship in Earth orbit.
 Picard is talking with GEORDI and Data near the pool table.
 Wesley, Locarno, Hajar, and Sito are gathered in the room, in the middle of a heated discussion.
 The room is empty and the lighting is subdued. Wesley is standing near the large monitor, holding the PADD seen earlier. On the screen is another SCHEMATIC DIAGRAM of Saturn and the Nova ships similar to the one seen earlier during Locarno's testimony. Wesley looks from the screen to the PADD and makes some notations on the PADD. Albert's voice interrupts his work.
 Wesley turns around to find Lt. Cmdr. Albert has just entered and is standing near the back of the room. He is carrying a sweater in one hand. Wesley quickly stands at attention.
 The Academy as seen before.
 Wesley is standing near the wall monitor and everyone else is in the same positions as seen in Act Two, including Picard and Beverly. The strain is starting to show on Wesley... he is tired and worn.
 The wall monitor shows a caption reading "SHIP'S LOG: CADET FOURTH CLASS WESLEY CRUSHER" and bearing the appropriate stardate. After a beat, the monitor comes to life and shows an INTERIOR VIEW of the cockpit of Wesley's ship.
 This is the beginning of our run toward Titan. I'm on the right wing.
 The view out the front of the canopy changes... a ship comes into view on the right of Wesley's canopy. The computer information on the screen indicates a change in course and speed.
 We just received the signal to begin the diamond slot formation. That's Cadet Locarno coming into view.
 The view from Wesley's ship changes... the stars move to indicate a turn... and then a MOON suddenly moves into view as the ship swoops down near its surface.
 Wesley is having trouble making out what he's seeing on the screen.
 The moon is just leaving the canopy on the screen when the picture finally BREAKS UP.
 Including Brand and Satelk.
 The monitor comes alive again and shows a view of space as seen from Saturn. The rings can be seen stretching away from the camera and one or two moons are visible.
 On the monitor, a cluster of tiny DOTS suddenly appear near the right edge of the frame.
 Magnify sector gamma three and enhance.
 The picture ZOOMS to the dots... revealing them as FIVE SHIPS. The ships are heading towards each other in a formation clearly different from the diamond slot seen earlier.
 The tension level in the room rises a notch. Locarno and the other two cadets glance at each other in shock... they can't believe this.
 In the audience, Picard immediately understands what's going on and he's shocked by the implications.
 Wesley stiffens slightly and braces himself for what he knows is coming.
 Beverly and Wesley. Beverly is taking charge; her maternal instincts have been aroused, and she's looking for a way to protect her son.
 As seen before. Boothby is kneeling in his flower bed, holding a clump of weeds and a withered plant as Picard comes over to him.

 Picard and Beverly on the move, heading toward engineering.
 Picard and Beverly ENTER. Geordi and Data are working at the pool table.
 FADE IN:
 The ship in orbit.
 Picard is sitting at his desk looking at something on the terminal when the door CHIMES.
 The screen shows a computer simulation of the five Nova ships as they head around Titan. The ships slingshot around the moon as seen before... go into a loop... then shoot off in opposing directions and perform an intricate maneuver which results in all five ships coming together at one point and then bursting outward simultaneously... a trail of BURNING PLASMA left in their wake. The image FREEZES on the five ships in the sunburst pattern.
 Wesley looks up at Picard who has never taken his eyes off him.
 Wesley is waiting in the room as Nick ENTERS. Wesley is very disturbed... uncertain about to do and a little scared.
 It's the next day. The room is once again filled with spectators, the flight team, Beverly, Picard, and Albert. Everyone is waiting... finally Brand and Satelk ENTER and take their seats. Brand strikes the bell and brings the room to order. She regards the flight team with a grim expression... her tone is somewhat challenging... she knows that something's wrong and that the cadets hold the answer, but she can't do anything about it.
 As he stands.
 he's concerned... he doesn't know what Wesley is going to do, but he hopes he'll do the right thing.
 He's not sure what Wesley's going to do either... will he resign or turn them all in?
 Brand glances at Satelk for a beat.
 The Academy as seen earlier.
 As seen earlier. Wesley is standing near the elm tree, waiting. After a beat, Picard comes over to him. Picard is grim... Wesley doesn't have to ask the question.
 PICARD, RIKER, DATA, and WORF; N.D.s as needed. The atmosphere on the bridge is tense -- they're in the middle of a pursuit and racing against a clock. Red alert is already on.
 Photon torpedoes burst from the forward tubes.
 The torpedoes speed toward a huge asteroid which is streaking toward a nearby planet, and EXPLODE against it.
 A direct hit, sir.
 A beam has emitted from the Enterprise into the asteroid core. It buzzes and hums for a second -- and then the core bursts apart.
 The target has been destroyed, sir.
 As the Enterprise flies through the debris, we see a host of small, Twinkling Bits of the shattered asteroid make contact with, and adhere to, the ship itself. Beat, then -- with Twinkling Stuff attached to its hull FADE IN:
 at warp speed.
 WORF and his son ALEXANDER sit stiffly -- side by side but separated by their anger at each other -- venting it all before a patient TROI.
 A Supernumerary stands alongside LWAXANA and MISTER HOMN. As she absently gestures Mister Homn to get a move on with the abundance of luggage he carries, she twines RIKER'S arm in hers.
 Troi and Lwaxana are seated -- Troi initially immobilized by her shock.
 as they ENTER. Heading for Troi's table, they're locked in animated debate.
 Picard and Riker move along the corridor, during:
 As Picard and Riker recede into b.g. along the corridor, CAMERA discovers -- along a seam of ceiling in f.g. -- a moving line of the Twinkling Particles seen earlier outside the ship. As it moves, the line drips, like drops of sparkling liquid, through the air to the flooring, where it forms a sort of glittering puddle. Beat -- then it disappears downward through the flooring itself.
 moving along at warp.
 Alexander sits, alone and disconsolate -- as Lwaxana ENTERS.
 Lwaxana and Alexander are headed for the (o.s.) holodeck.
 as, having entered, Lwaxana and Alexander look off (o.s.) to see:
 which descends toward them. Contained in the sphere is a wild, wonderful alien face...
 react as the sphere bounces in front of them... then SHOOTS back up and out of sight.
 Standing by herself in the clearing, a Fire Artist holds a burning firebrand in her hand. She brings it up close to her mouth, and, exhaling deeply, uses her breath (which catches fire) to create a lovely fire design in the air before it finally disappears.
 Alexander is wide-eyed at the (o.s.) sight.
 as he ENTERS both FRAME and the conversation. Constantly juggling several multicolored, variously sized balls.
 Emerging from behind a structure are a YOUNG, extremely attractive (humanoid) MAN & WOMAN.
 A tall, white-bearded old POET, in white toga, suddenly appears before them, with hand raised -- like Moses
 Beat -- then he rushes back to the locale of the still-arguing Young Man and Woman, and:
 Lwaxana is delighted with Alexander; welcomes him with a hug.
 Worf is tidying up after Alex, as his door CHIMES.
 At the moment, all bathers hold high a form of (edible) cup, containing some liquid, in a general toast:
 All the creatures within us?
 as Troi and Worf arrive; look around. Suddenly, the Wind Dancer descends toward them -- a menacing look on his face. The ball dances in front of Worf, blocking him from moving forward. Frustrated, Worf SWATS him aside -- and the Wind Dancer pops! Worf and Troi exchange a surprised look and move forward. MUSIC as well (a one instrument tune, the rhythm of which is not unlike that which would accompany a 20th- century bellydance). Troi and Worf begin Walking toward the (o.s.) sounds.
 A great-looking Tattooed Female Dancer is entertaining our group (including Alexander, of course, whose joyous receptiveness is in concert with that of everyone else).
 They just gape -- in total stunhood.
 A slightly rigid Troi confronts a thoroughly relaxed Lwaxana.
 As she's speaking -- and to her sudden great perplexion replicator and sits in the tea cup.
 Geordi and Data are running a diagnostic at their respective consoles:
 Geordi and Data crawl toward us to a panel in immediate f.g. Geordi carries his tool kit; both have tricorders at the ready.
 Lwaxana, wearing a not-unflattering wedding dress, stands before a mirror as MISTER HOMN finishes tailoring it on her. Homm wears a large pin cushion around his forearm, and carries pins in his mouth.
 on the back of Alexander's head, as he faces the door. It opens -- to reveal Mister Homn's lower extremities at Alex's eye level. As Alexander looks slowly upward along Mister Homn's body, CAMERA FOLLOWS HIS GAZE -- until Alex, and we, are looking far up at the looming face of Mister Homn.
 as Lwaxana sees Alexander at the door; brightens; waves him toward her, during:
 As Geordi and Data report to Picard, Riker is in his command chair; Worf at tactical; and an ENSIGN at the conn.
 On impulse power.
 Geordi and Data face Picard and Riker. On the table before them rests a covered petri dish in which is a glob of the orange goo seen earlier.
 A relatively small vessel, from Kostolain, stands adjacent to the Enterprise.
 Troi and Lwaxana wait as a Transporter Operator, standing alongside his panel, causes CAMPIO and his entourage of one, ERKO, to MATERIALIZE. Campio is a fine-looking, mid-50's humanoid -- patrician in posture and manner; eminently gracious. Erko is an older, pompous-appearing stiff.
 as, moving briskly, he ENTERS.
 They exchange a quick, almost involuntary glance of mutual apprehension at this mismatch-in-the-making.
 Excepting the Transporter Room Officer, the group emerges into the corridor, as:
 Certainly. Our culture is so totally new to you. I assure you of my utmost patience. And any tutoring you may desire about our customs, in addition to those regarding the wedding procedures...
 as Geordi and Data work at the consoles, keying controls, scrolling data, etc.
 As Worf brings food for Alexander and himself, the boy is doing a breathing exercise: Holding his hands against the sides of his diaphragm, he first inhales deeply -- holds it for a beat -- then exhales with a loud and happy-faced blurt of:
 Troi sits with a confused, disconsolate Worf. She, too, seems a bit downtrodden... as weary of dealing with her mother as Worf is of coping with Alexander.
 Alexander sits, an interested observer, looking up at Lwaxana standing on one side of him, and Campio on the other. Erko is in b.g. behind Campio; Mister Homn in b.g. behind Lwaxana.
 For one beat, she shoots Erko a look that indicates she'd like to drop-kick him into the next county.
 As Alex approaches the doors, they open -- and we see Troi and Worf just arriving. Those two ENTER, with:
 Data, with tricorder, has been examining the dilithium chamber housing. In b.g., tricorder sweeps are also being made by two crewpersons. Data rounds a corner and into --
 where Geordi is inspecting power transfer conduits.
 He traces the "hot spot" to the panel seam. As he removes the panel itself: Beat -- and then a FLOOD of orange goo comes down through the panel opening. As Geordi's recovering from that surprise, he's startled anew by the "escape" of a much larger amount of the as it travels up another seam and disappears into another duct.
 His face reflects his stunned incredulity.
 at impulse power.
 Lwaxana and Alexander sit on the edge of the mudbath, their feet dangling down. The JUGGLER sits cross-legged nearby; obviously forlorn -- and with nothing to juggle.
 The holodeck wall grid is peeking through. A great gob of Orange Goo flows out of the grid -- cutting through the "fantasy" world.
 She stiffens with apprehension.
 Something's wrong.
 The Orange Goo continues flowing downward.
 Geordi and Data with Picard.
 As Picard and Data move briskly to the turbolift, and ENTER.
 as Picard and Data ride upward:
 Orange Goo begins oozing out, spilling down along the wall. It's coming in larger quantities than we've seen before.
 react to the sight. Another beat, and --
 The turbolift doors are pried open by Data. Picard slips out, followed by Data, and the doors SNAP shut behind them. Red Alert is already on. Picard moves to command, Data to ops, as:
 as Geordi labors at his console, a loud, intermittent BUZZING sound issues from the engine room. In b.g., crewpersons are spraying a cold gas around wall panels and the dilithium chamber.
 Lwaxana and Alexander, hand in hand, are among the several others being ushered through the corridor by security personnel.
 Geordi is still at one of the consoles. The crewpersons continue to spray various parts of engineering.
 Everybody here is beginning -- visibly -- to perspire. Orange Goo is seen oozing from several wall panels. Another alarm sounds, and one of the consoles starts blinking warning lights. Geordi rushes to that console.
 Everybody is now not only perspiring profusely, but is now having some breathing difficulty (excepting, of course, Data).
 drops out of warp with the asteroid field in view.
 Data is the only one conscious on the bridge.
 We see myriad multisized asteroids in a gigantic field.
 A particle beam shoots from the ship to the nearest asteroid. A beat -- and then masses of the "Twinkling Stuff" ride the beam, off the Enterprise and onto the asteroid.
 Red Alert is off... People are beginning to regain consciousness. Picard is waking up, trying to clear his head.
 moving at impulse.
 From somewhere (o.s.), formal (dull) wedding music plays. At the makeshift altar stands Erko, who is to officiate. To his right, Picard and Riker; to his left, Troi and Alexander. In the center stands the ritually robed, pleasantly expectant Campio. All await the (o.s.) bride.
 You'd think she'd at least get to her own wedding on time.
 She is smiling infectiously, happily, at everyone. Though we see only noncensorable parts of her, it is obvious that she has made this appearance STARK NAKED.
 Thunderstruck.
 Open-mouthed, wide-eyed horror.
 The beginnings of a relieved, certainly understanding, smile.
 She not only saves her most radiant expression for (the o.s.) Alexander, but throws him a conspiratorial WINK to boot.
 In response, he once again grins happily from ear to ear.
 Erko takes Campio's arm.
 She shrugs. C'est la vie, folks.
 She sits contentedly in the mudbath... draws a deep breath of contentment.
 leaving orbit around the planet Krios.
 PICARD and the Kriosian Ambassador, BRIAM. Briam is tall, almost frail-looking, and his people have dark skin and hair, much in the manner of those from Earth's Indian subcontinent. Picard hands him a cup of tea.
 We've picked up a distress call from a Ferengi shuttle...
 As they rise to EXIT...
 coming out of warp...
 Picard has joined RIKER, WORF and DATA on the bridge.
 As the TRANSPORTER OFFICER works his controls. Two figures MATERIALIZE on the pads...
 where TWO FERENGI now stand, smiling their toothy grins.
 Mister Worf, escort our Ferengi guests to quarters... Understood.
 As Worf comes around a corner leading the Ferengi...
 As they ENTER...
 At warp.
 Picard, Geordi and Briam arrive outside the holodeck...
 Still in awe, Briam inspects the setting...
 as Qol slips inside. The room is dimly lit, he looks around to make sure he is alone. His eyes widen as he gets his first look at the "gift" he has come to steal.
 Suspended several feet off the ground in a zero-gravity field is a pod about the same size as an Egyptian style sarcophagus; its decorations, though alien-looking, are every bit as elaborate. The gravity field casts a shimmering light on it, giving this floating jewel an almost magical look.
 reacts, excited...
 As the door opens and Picard, Briam and Geordi emerge from the holodeck...
 Qol stacks crates and canisters and climbs up to get a better look at the sarcophagus...
 looking across sarcophagus.
 At the turbolift, Picard waits impatiently for the lift to arrive... shoots Geordi a look as the Ferengi continues to drill the Ambassador...
 Picard hits his combadge.
 WORF at tactical.
 As Worf leads in his security team... sees Qol up on the makeshift ladder near the sarcophagus... taking readings with a Ferengi tricorder...
 he's interrupted by Picard, Riker and Briam's arrival... Briam reacts with horror...
 The outer shell is now completely gone, revealing a cocoon-like structure underneath, as if a Human figure were wrapped in some sort of organic matter. This, too, begins to dissolve away. The figure underneath the organic casing is now becoming visible.
 They can only stare in amazement.
 now revealed to be the most exotic and beautiful woman we have ever seen. Her green eyes are set off by her dark skin and hair; she wears a long, diaphanous gown.
 She looks around the room, and though her features seem to indicate that she was expecting to emerge into an entirely different setting (the reconciliation ceremony), she never loses her serene, almost regal composure.
 Continuous action.
 Kamala and Riker walk...
 As they enter...
 Listen... this has been... educational... but I've made it a policy never to open another man's gift...
 As the door slides closed behind Riker, he catches his breath... beads of sweat on his brow, his collar tight... he hits his combadge...
 at warp.
 Close on a teacup... The voices are sharp...
 As the door slides open to reveal Picard... Kamala greeting him...
 Briam is sitting at a percussive instrument, striking the chimes in a strict cadence, practicing a definite order...
 Close on Kamala...
 As Data and Kamala enter... the bar is crowded... some of those miners we picked up on the way are lined up at the bar... they haven't seen a woman in seventeen months, let alone a woman like this... and as Data and she move slowly by, each male's head turns as those pheromones wallop them...
 sitting with Worf, laughing, drinking an ale... makes eye contact with Kamala across the room... reacts, knows his duty... downs his drink... standing...
 as her smiles fades... A miner walks up to Kamala...
 Thank you again, Lieutenant.
 Close on an entirely different Kamala... gentle, conservative, thoughtful... moving to find Picard sitting with her... frustrated...
 Par Lenor and Qor react as the door slides open and Briam storms in, passing the guard...
 waiting at the rendezvous coordinates.
 Beverly and a MEDICAL TEAM are working on the unconscious Briam as Picard and an anxious Kamala stand off to the side.
 as before.
 Close on the percussive instrument... as the small hammer strikes the chimes... seven times... pull back to see Picard holding it, concentrating... he hesitates...
 Close on the back of ALRIK, the man who will wed this extraordinary woman... we hear the sound of the door opening as Picard ENTERS (o.c.)... and he turns and already we don't like him on first sight... he is drab, a dull, dull man... he's colorless and stern... and far shorter than Kamala... he is about Picard's age.
 So, tell me quickly... what is he like?
 First impressions? A thoughtful man... informed...
 with the Valtese ship beside it.
 Beverly and Picard again sharing morning tea. A parallel scene to the one in Act Two. Picard is lost in his own thoughts.
 Picard arrives at Kamala's door... a beat... hits the chime...
 Kamala in front of a huge mirror... dressed in the most incredible gown a woman has ever worn... she is a goddess... she turns to Picard... a beat as he takes this vision in... he will never forget how she looks at this moment.
 Starting on an ornate decoration on the wall... with a cymbal crash... and exotic percussive music begins... and tilt down to a high angle shot to see the figure of Alrik in the center of the room... as the holodeck doors open and...
 turns to see --
 entering... Picard holds her arm... her face is veiled...
 as they step forward slowly...
 as they move closer to Alrik...
 He offers her hand to the hand of Alrik... as he does the percussion stops.
 as Alrik removes the veil.
 The music cue ends. This is real... all fantasies are over. Only the exotic percussive music program for the ceremony.

 Briam, still weak, head bruised... enters with Picard... a Transporter Officer is on duty...
 Low lighting... as he enters... pauses once inside to feel himself alone... won't allow himself to stay with that... moves to the replicator...
 Moves off into warp.
 CLARA SUTTER, a seven-year-old girl, and TROI sit at a table set for tea. The settings include a place for Clara's imaginary friend, Isabella. Troi is chatting with Clara...
 on the outskirts of a large NEBULA -- a glowing expanse of swirling red clouds, with a bright point of light deep in its center.
 PICARD, RIKER, DATA, WORF, ENSIGN FELTON and VARIOUS NDS at stations. GEORDI is at an aft science station. Everyone watches the main viewscreen, which displays the nebula -- a rare and special sight.
 as it enters the nebula. Suddenly, from within a nearby cloud -- a tiny POINT OF LIGHT appears. The light FLARES briefly as it passes through the ship's shield bubble... then it ENTERS through the hull of the ship...
 As small section of the ceiling GLOWS briefly with a red color, and a POINT OF LIGHT emerges into the corridor (as seen in the nebula). The light pauses, then zips around a corner and out of view. Clearly a life-form is now on board...
 The POINT OF LIGHT comes into view -- right behind Data and Geordi, who are walking briskly down the corridor, on their way to engineering, talking TECH...
 BEVERLY and NURSE OGAWA are working at a medical station, mid-conversation. During this scene, out of their view, a small section of the wall GLOWS with a red color, and the point of LIGHT emerges into the room. The light flits about, as if watching Beverly and Ogawa from afar...
 as it zips into a nearby hypospray, causing it to GLOW for an instant. After a beat, the light exits the hypospray and zips into a nearby tricorder, which glows... and into another medical tool -- all in quick succession. The light is exploring its environment. Over which we HEAR --
 Lush and beautiful (as seen in "Data's Day".) A section of the wall GLOWS red -- the POINT OF LIGHT zips into a nearby gardening tool... then EXITS...
 The light enters an exotic-looking flower, causing the flower to GLOW -- but this glow is different, longer and more intense. The glow vanishes and a duplicate flower appears next to the original. Just as quickly, the duplicate flower disappears into a tiny red dot, which instantly DEMATERIALIZES...
 The glowing pinpoint of light MATERIALIZES again and stops, as if spotting Clara. It hovers, as if watching her from afar...
 She is by herself, kneeling on a patch of dirt among the trees and bushes. As she plants seeds into the soil, she talks to her imaginary friend Isabella...
 As before. Clara facing Isabella, confused by the sight -- after all, she's never actually seen her imaginary friend.
 Geordi, Data and Sutter working at various consoles, collecting data from the nebula. N.D.s as needed. Geordi's console displays a GRAPHIC of the nebula.
 Picard, Riker, Worf, Ensign Felton at stations.
 As before. Sutter works for a beat.
 as Clara ENTERS. She walks straight into the room and starts looking around, oblivious to the seriousness of the situation.
 Clara exits engineering. A beat, then Isabella MATERIALIZES behind her. Clara reacts to the sudden appearance.
 As before -- everyone hard at work.
 Clara waiting. Isabella APPEARS.
 Picard, Riker, Data, Geordi discussing their situation.
 Clara and Isabella are walking along. They pass a large door, which Isabella eyes with curiosity.
 rounding a corner at a good clip. Both girls nearly collide with him. They stop, breathless and startled by the towering Klingon. Worf gives the girls a stern look.
 Sutter is working at a console in Geordi's office as Geordi ENTERS.
 Data and Guinan are sitting at the row of windows, observing the spectacular VIEW of the NEBULA.
 as Clara ENTERS and proceeds into the room. She looks around, bravely venturing into the room full of grown-ups...
 as they notice Clara across the room.
 as she ENTERS Ten Forward. She spots Clara and crosses to her. She's gentle, but concerned...
 Troi and Clara walking up to a turbolift. Troi hits the button by the door and they wait...
 Troi and Clara ENTER.
 Troi and Sutter together in Sutter's side of the room (Clara's room is adjacent, separated by a door).
 Clara is putting together a futuristic jigsaw puzzle. She is solemn, after all that's happened today. Isabella watches from across the room... then finally approaches her...
 moving through the nebula.
 Picard, Data, and Worf; Felton at the conn.
 Geordi and Sutter are studying a clear TUBE, which contains a sampling of red gas from the nebula. Sutter scans the tube with a TECH device, while Geordi works a console.
 Troi and Clara ENTER and take in the scene. A handful of CHILDREN are at various tables, working on their ceramic projects. Worf's son, ALEXANDER, is sitting alone at a table. Clara, extremely shy, clings to Troi as they cross to Alexander's table...
 Picard, Riker, Data, Worf and Ensign Felton. Geordi at the aft science station. N.D.s as needed.
 The red clouds of the nebula illuminate with a GLOW -- revealing an incredible sight: There are ENERGY STRANDS all over the place. They surround the ship on all sides -- an impossibly complex latticework of energy, like a spider's web. (NOTE: None of the strands is touching the ship.)
 Reactions to the beautiful and alarming sight.
 Troi ENTERS, crosses to a replicator food slot.
 Alexander and Clara have finished the cup, and are now having snacks with the other children -- juice and crackers. They're getting along well... Alexander trying to show off a little, and Clara suitably impressed.
 Clara ENTERS, and runs to the clearing in the soil where she was planting seeds. She sits on the ground and grabs her knees, crying softly to herself...
 Picard, Riker, Data, Geordi, Worf, Ensign Felton. N.D.s as needed. The VIEWSCREEN shows the complex latticework of energy strands.
 There are even more ENERGY STRANDS than seen in Act Two. We see the ship's "POV" as it pushes through the dense strands, as if moving through seaweed...
 Troi is sitting alone at a table, an untouched slice of chocolate cake at her side. She is idly drawing little circles on the table with a finger... lost in thought, doodling aimlessly. Guinan passes by, notices Troi in her absorption, and stops. Troi is oblivious... keeps tracing designs with her finger.
 Later. Clara is sitting across the room, in her nightclothes, ready for bed. She looks pale and quiet. Troi and Sutter are talking quietly by the door...
 Troi and Clara ENTER: They take a preliminary glance around the room -- it's empty.
 As Troi slides open the door... The closet is empty.
 Isabella is standing right behind Clara-- she is staring directly at Troi with a cold expression. Troi reacts, completely stunned to see the girl. Before she can utter a word, Isabella raises a hand and throws out a STRAND OF RED ENERGY -- the strand HITS Troi and knocks her backward --
 Troi is lying on a bed, conscious but extremely weak. Picard and Sutter stand close by, while Beverly scans Troi with a medical tricorder. Troi is recounting what happened in a frail voice...
 Worf reacts to the description, realizing...
 Two days ago, near engineering. She was with Miss Sutter.
 Picard ENTERS. Riker, Worf, Data, Geordi and Ensign Felton are working.
 as it comes to a stop. The ship is immersed in an astounding amount of ENERGY STRANDS -- ten times as many. They surround the ship like a spider's web -- tendrils draped over the ship, tangling it deeper...
 As before. Worf reacts to his console.
 Something is visible moving through the strands -- it looks like a spindly BALL of crackling ENERGY. And it's heading toward the ship...
 Picard, Worf, Sutter and Clara ENTER. Clara breaks free from the adults and starts to search for Isabella. She calls out softly...
 As she MATERIALIZES in the clearing where Clara was planting seeds. Her face is neutral. Picard, Worf and Sutter react to the sight. Isabella sees them and tenses. Picard proceeds with caution...
 The spindly balls of energy, the creatures, move away from their positions on the ship... and head back into the nebula. A moment later, the energy strands attached to the Enterprise begin to fall away, freeing the ship...
 Riker, Data, Geordi, Felton. Picard and Worf ENTER and take their stations.
 Clara ENTERS from Sutter's room and sits down on her bed. She yawns, tired after all that's happened. A quiet moment passes by as she pulls back her covers and fluffs her pillow...
 coming out of the nebula.
 Dropping out of warp speed as it enters a star system.
 PICARD, RIKER, and TROI are in the command area, DATA at ops, WORF at tactical; various SUPERNUMERARIES fill the other posts as needed.
 PAN ACROSS a snowy, frozen landscape to take in the scattered wreckage of a crashed spacecraft -- charred metal and ship's innards litter the area. The AWAY TEAM (BEVERLY, Riker, Worf) MATERIALIZES in the foreground. Beverly scans with her medical tricorder.
 she sees something...
 to reveal a person's legs emerging out from under some debris. She gestures for Riker and Worf to help her and they lift it off.
 as they see the survivor's face for the first time.
 We understand why they reacted as they did -- the survivor is a Borg...
 Beverly is scanning the survivor's still form; she checks a reading and administers the appropriate hypo. The Borg is an adolescent male -- one of his arms is a mechanical prosthetic, as is one of his eyes. Riker stands, his face is troubled. Worf has already drawn his phaser; Riker raises a hand that it's all right, then keys his combadge.
 It's a Borg.
 Riker and Beverly react.
 Your concern is noted, Doctor. But any intervention on your part would only alert the Borg to our having been here.
 Throughout this exchange, Beverly has never stopped treating the Borg.
 Picard doesn't like either of his options. Reluctantly, he chooses to allow Beverly to continue.
 Relieved, Beverly smiles, and continues her ministrations.
 Mister Data, notify security to prepare a detention cell. Bridge to engineering.
 GEORDI at a science station.
 Worf has discovered several other dead Borg scattered among the shuttle debris. He returns to Riker and Beverly, who is still treating the injured Borg.
 There is a moment as Picard accepts this; then, without a word, he stands and EXITS to his ready room. Troi looks after him for a beat, then rises.
 Picard is rounding his desk as the door CHIMES. He stops, glances toward it, seems mildly irritated.
 in orbit around the moon.
 Picard approaches Geordi, Worf, and two SECURITY PERSONNEL who stand outside the force field. A NURSE is just entering the cell.
 FADE IN:
 Riker, Data, Beverly, and Troi; Picard and Geordi have just finished explaining their plan. Of the group, Beverly has the most troubled response.
 The Borg is moving along the perimeter of the detention cell's wall, feeling his way, looking up and down as he covers every square inch of the wall. He is a young man of about eighteen, and though possessing the intimidating Borg characteristics -- prosthetic arm, eye, etc. -- he nonetheless exudes the vulnerability of youth. A portable SENSOR device is visible in the cell. As he encounters the force field, he reacts, stepping back and proceeding with his careful exploration of the walls.
 outside the force field: Picard, Geordi, Beverly, and the security team.
 Two figures are fencing. It soon becomes clear that one of them is less adept than the other. He or she is forced to retreat just to stay in the match -- but retreat only delays the inevitable. The better fencer lunges and makes a touch.
 Geordi and Worf ENTER and cross toward the two Guards, who stand to either side of the Borg's cell; Geordi is carrying the power conduit he has constructed.
 Geordi with Beverly, making plans to transport the Borg. Geordi has hooked up a power conduit similar to the one Geordi set up in the detention cell. There are consoles, monitors, equipment, etc.
 in orbit around the moon.
 The Borg is looking at a topographical representation of a complex geometric shape DISPLAYED on a SCREEN (where shaded lines represent the far side of the shape as seen through its solid mass).
 Geordi at the bar; Guinan listening.
 in orbit around the moon where the Borg ship was found.
 Picard ENTERS from his ready room. Data is at ops, Riker is standing, looking over his shoulder.
 The concern on his face is evident.
 Guinan ENTERS and crosses toward the cell where the Borg is being held. She and the security guards exchange a nod.
 as she sees the Borg for the first time. Myriad feelings rise in her.
 as he sees her. He moves forward in a curious, friendly way. They stare at each other for a moment.
 in orbit around the moon.
 Geordi is with the Borg. Worf is not present -- they are alone, attesting to the comfort Geordi is feeling about Hugh's presence. Geordi is working with the prosthetic armpiece while Hugh watches with interest.
 Geordi and Data are showing Picard the programming anomaly they've designed. A topographical map of a complex geometric shape is displayed on the wall monitor. There is something odd about it, like an M.C. Escher drawing, where perspective is played with.
 Picard is ready for bed, carrying a cup of tea and a book toward the bedroom. The door CHIME sounds.
 Picard paces. Then, the call he's been waiting for.
 Picard, Geordi, Riker, and Beverly. Pick up in mid-conversation.
 Hugh is looking at Picard's fish tank, intrigued. A security guard stands by the door, watching him. The door opens and Picard and Geordi ENTER. Picard dismisses the guard with a nod.
 in orbit around the moon.
 Geordi and Beverly are there with Hugh; a Transporter Chief is behind the console. Picard ENTERS.
 Geordi and Hugh MATERIALIZE into the snowy landscape. They move toward the wreckage of the Borg scout ship. Hugh gazes at the remains of his ship, the still-scattered bodies of his colleagues.
 as it takes position on the far side of the star.
 Picard, Riker, Data, Worf.
 Geordi and Hugh. They are awkward... the time has come for goodbyes... neither knows how to say them. Geordi is feeling more than he could ever have imagined possible.
 They MATERIALIZE nearby, somewhat close to Geordi. They look around for a moment, their dispassionate gaze sweeping past Geordi, and fixing on Hugh. They move toward Geordi... but then walk right past him, heading for Hugh.
 as the two Borg approach Hugh. One of them interfaces with him -- connecting through the jacks on their prosthetic arms. They are exchanging information.
 doesn't know what this means. Has the Hugh he knew been obliterated by assimilation back into the hive?
 When Hugh moves, it is with the same mechanical gait as the others. The three Borg set about scavenging the remains of their dead comrades -- they remove the technological components they're interested in efficiently and without evident emotion. As they finish with the dead Borg, the corpses FIZZLE into nothingness.
 Geordi is unsure: Hugh seems no different from the other Borg... or is he merely acting the part?
 The three Borg assemble, carrying what they've scavenged. They all stare straight ahead as they TRANSPORT OUT -- but just before Hugh DEMATERIALIZES he turns and looks at Geordi. Their eyes meet, it is unmistakable. Then he's gone...
 He is hopeful that this last look means something of Hugh will survive assimilation... Still, the thought of what lies ahead for Hugh fills him with sadness...
 The ship at warp.
 PICARD, DATA, and TROI at their stations. ENSIGN McDOWELL is at tactical. The ship is on YELLOW ALERT and there is a sense of urgency in the air.
 RIKER and WORF are standing near the platform. GEORDI and RO ENTER, carrying large tool kits. Everyone has tricorders and phasers. CHIEF BROSSMER, a woman in her forties, is standing behind the console.
 The ship drops out of warp.
 The Enterprise moves alongside a ROMULAN SCIENCE SHIP which is about half the size of the Enterprise.
 The engine room is a wreck. There are blown out consoles, burnt panels, flames, smoke, DEAD BODIES, etc. The room is smaller than engineering on the Enterprise and should reflect very different ideas about engineering design and philosophy than those we are familiar with. Their engine core is a spherical device contained within a small chamber which has a single open hatch.
 Riker moves to him and the Romulans follow. Geordi and Ro have removed a piece of equipment about the size of a footlocker from the console. It looks fused and burnt.
 Brossmer is struggling to bring them aboard... STRANGE SHAPES and EFFECTS dance on the transporter pad. It's unlike any transporter effect we've seen before.
 Riker and Worf wait for them to reappear... nothing. After a long beat...
 Only a few minutes have passed since the end of the Teaser. Picard and Troi are reacting to the loss of Ro
 Riker is standing off by himself in the engine room. He has to put aside his feelings for now to deal with the emergency.
 Picard thinks for a beat.
 The two ships as seen before.
 Riker moves to where Mirok and Varel are working on a console. The atmosphere is tense and urgent.
 As Worf and an N.D. Romulan ENTER through a doorway. They both look dirty and bedraggled.
 Revealing Data and TWO N.D. ENGINEERS now standing in the engine room. Riker and Worf step aside as Data moves quickly to the jammed doors. With a burst of android strength, he PULLS the doors together and seals the chamber.
 The two ships are side by side. Suddenly, there is a flash of LIGHT from the bottom of the Romulan ship and an EXPLOSION a short distance away from the ship. But the blast from the explosion is kept away from the two ships by the shields of the Enterprise, which now surround both vessels. (It is the explosion which makes the shields visible.)
 As before. The room SHAKES slightly then stops. Everyone is standing still in the gloomy darkness. After a beat, Riker turns to Mirok and a slow smile spreads across his face.
 The ship hangs in space.
 Picard is listening to Riker's report.
 Picard ENTERS from a turbolift. He walks along the corridor, lost in thought... his expression is grim and deeply disturbed. Follow him for a moment... then as he rounds a corner CAMERA DROPS OFF ON Ensign Ro, who is sitting near a corridor intersection.
 As Ro reaches sickbay. When she gets to the door, she pulls up short as it refuses to open. Before she can reach out to touch the door in puzzlement, it suddenly OPENS and a N.D. CREWPERSON ENTERS the corridor from sickbay. He barrels past her without a glance. (To Ro, he seems rude, but again, the Crewman never sees her.) Ro gives him an irritated look and goes through the still open door before it closes behind her.
 Ro ENTERS. N.D. NURSES & PATIENTS go about their business without noticing Ro standing near the doorway. She tries to get their attention.
 Picard and BEVERLY are in the middle of an argument in the office. Ro pauses in the doorway, naturally reluctant to interrupt the conversation.
 Picard turns to leave Beverly alone. Ro steps directly in his path, determined to put a stop to this for once and for all.
 Continuous from Act One. Ro is trying to get her bearings in this bizarre situation. She can't believe what just happened with Picard. Beverly is still sitting at her desk, working at a terminal. Ro tries once again to get her attention.
 As Ro moves around the desk behind Beverly. She leans over Beverly to see what she's doing on the terminal.
 The terminal was showing a picture of Geordi and some biographical information. It quickly changes to a picture of Ro and her bio information. Beverly reaches out and touches a control... the word "DECEASED" suddenly appears at the bottom of the file.
 As Ro reacts to this. Beverly is resigned... a little sad. Ro is starting to come to the frightening realization that this is all very real.
 The atmosphere is more orderly and calm than before. N.D. ROMULANS and N.D. STARFLEET CREWMEN are moving busily about the room in the b.g. hauling equipment, fixing consoles, etc. Mirok is seated at one of the consoles as Riker stands next to him. The lights are DIM.
 A BEAM OF ENERGY leaps out from a spot on the Enterprise and makes a connection to a point on the Romulan ship near the engines.
 As before. Suddenly the LIGHTS BRIGHTEN and there is a HUM of power as several monitors and consoles come back to life.
 Picard and Data are at one of the aft stations.
 Worf approaches Riker, clearly upset.
 Geordi is wandering through the room.
 as Geordi whirls around to find Ro standing there.
 The ship hangs in space.
 McDowell at the aft science station, N.D. Crewmembers at the other positions. Ro ENTERS with an N.D. Crewman from the turbolift. Her attitude is serene. She seems genuinely content for the moment, as if a burden has been lifted from her shoulders. A smile comes more easily to her than we've seen before.
 Picard, Riker, and Ro ENTER.
 Revealing that Geordi has just entered.
 The shuttlecraft leaves the ship.
 Worf and Data are at the controls, Geordi and Ro are sitting on some pieces of equipment in the back.
 Data is with Mirok and Varel. In the b.g., a MALE ROMULAN is seated in a chair within earshot, but he appears to be watching a console. Worf is supervising the placement of equipment they have carried in the shuttle.
 Geordi removes his head from the console and beckons to Ro.
 As Geordi and Ro leave, the seated Male Romulan seen earlier turns around and WATCHES THEM LEAVE. After a beat, he stands up and follows Ro & Geordi by walking THROUGH THE CHAIR. He is in the same strange state as they are -- the other Romulans are unaware of him as he silently heads after our characters.
 The two ships are side by side, and still connected by the beam of energy.
 CLOSE ON doors, which clearly say "Shuttlebay Two". The doors OPEN and THREE N.D. CREWMEMBERS walk out into the corridor... then the Phased Romulan -- hereafter referred to as PAREM -- steps out into the corridor. He pauses for a moment and looks around... then heads off in search of Ro & Geordi.
 Geordi and Ro are looking at various monitors in Geordi's office. They're worried by what they see.
 As Ro and Geordi go out into the main area. Data and Brossmer are working at the pool table.
 The turbolift doors OPEN and TWO N.D. CREWMEMBERS ENTER the corridor. After a quick beat, Parem FOLLOWS them out of the turbolift and into the corridor. He takes a look around and then heads off down the corridor.
 Geordi is watching Data finish making adjustments to an anyon emitter. Data picks up a tricorder and scans the room.
 The turbolift doors OPEN and Brossmer and Ro ENTER. Brossmer moves toward the aft science station and Ro moves to follow... but Ro suddenly stops short in shock as she sees...
 Standing on the bridge, leveling his disruptor directly at Ro.
 Geordi continues trying to get Data's attention without success.
 He's in here.
 Ro ENTERS THROUGH the doors. In the brief second before Parem comes through behind her, Ro whirls around and HITS him hard just as Parem ENTERS. The blow catches Parem unaware and he staggers back. She runs toward the far wall of the transporter room. Parem recovers quickly and FIRES a disruptor blast at her.
 As she runs THROUGH the wall. The disruptor blast just misses her and goes THROUGH the wall. Parem runs after her.
 As before. Data is still working at the pool table.
 A WOMAN, wearing only a towel, is brushing her hair in front of the mirror.
 Data and Geordi are walking down the corridor. Data is pointing the tricorder at one wall as they walk... Geordi is also watching the readouts.
 A MAN, wearing exercise clothes, is doing push-ups on the floor.
 Data and Geordi are still walking down the corridor. They are both still following the tricorder readings.
 The room has been set for a romantic evening. Soft MUSIC is playing in the b.g.... the lights are DIM... A MAN and a WOMAN are sitting at the table... the remains of an intimate dinner still on the table before them. He is feeding her oysters and there is a sexually-charged tension between the two of them. She eats the oyster and then washes it down with champagne... he leans over and whispers something funny into her ear... she laughs and runs a hand over his cheek... then she picks up some food and feeds it to him...
 Data and Geordi stop. They both react to an unusual reading on the tricorder.
 Parem goes over to Ro, who is clutching her wounded leg. In the b.g., the door CHIMES.
 rushes Parem...
 gets to the disruptor first. He picks it up and turns...
 But Geordi drops his shoulder and nails Parem with a body tackle before he can turn the disruptor on Geordi. The impact makes Parem DROP the disruptor and KNOCKS him backwards... THROUGH THE WALL and out into SPACE. Through the window, we see him FLOAT away into space.
 As before. Geordi moves over to Ro as Data finishes checking the room with his tricorder in the b.g. Ro picks up the fallen disruptor.
 Picard and McDowell are working at their stations. Brossmer is working at the aft science station. Ro and Geordi are looking over McDowell's shoulder.
 Mirok appears on the viewer.
 Deck Ten.
 Picard and Riker ENTER, followed by Geordi and Ro. They all stop in some amazement at the scene that greets them. It's a party, in full swing. The atmosphere is lively and bright, with food and drink in evidence. A JAZZ COMBO plays something uptempo and cheerful.
 As they eye the crowd.
 As Riker barrels right by her --
 They're near the bar. Geordi moves to a position to overhear this conversation.
 The WHINE grows LOUDER. Then the disruptor EXPLODES in a blinding FLASH. No one pays any attention. Only Geordi and Ro are affected, and stumble against a far wall as the blast reaches them.
 as he reacts to something.
 MATERIALIZE for a flickering instant, almost subliminally, arms waving. The SOUND stops. Note: Only a few people in the room see this -- everyone else continues to drink, laugh, be merry, etc.
 Did you see that?
 Conversation in the room comes to a halt as everyone looks at the shapes MATERIALIZING before them. Finally the shapes resolve themselves and Ro and Geordi APPEAR. They stagger to their feet as a shocked hush fills the room.
 at impulse.
 The party is over, the place is a mess and there is no one there -- except Geordi and Ro, sitting at a table. It is heaped with food. Geordi is still eating ravenously, but Ro is not showing much interest in the food.
 warps away.
 at warp.
 PICARD, RIKER, DATA, WORF, and GEORDI at their positions; N.D.'s as necessary. There is a light-hearted mood on the bridge.
 An alien object of unusual shape can be seen, though still at quite a distance. Picard moves toward the screen, between t conn and ops.
 As he falls, losing consciousness, Riker's hand ENTERS FRAME behind Picard's head so as to protect it, cushion it, against the hard deck toward which it's falling...
 Riker's face leaning in close...
 ELINE, a fine looking mid-thirtyish woman -- whose face becomes a thing of radiance when she smiles -- leans over him, blotting his forehead with a moist towel.
 He realizes he's seated in a deep and comfortable chair in the modest, certainly unusual (to us), but well-kept and inviting main room of what is apparently a home. In addition to the front entry, there are openings to the (o.s.) kitchen and (o.s.) bedroom. Picard just peers around; confused.
 Picard and Eline just as they were. He's up and moving, inspecting the room.
 The dwelling is smooth and pale, with the appearance of a Mediterranean villa. There is a modest front courtyard with a garden -- now blooming with odd and alien flora. Picard steps out into the courtyard, shading his eyes against the bright sunlight; stops as the door closes behind him to survey the area. Eline follows him, concerned.
 More of the white stucco-like dwellings, a square area in the center where SEVERAL TOWNFOLK have gathered. A fine-looking, pretty-faced youngish woman crosses Picard's path en route to the gathered group. She smiles in recognition, and waves at him as she goes.
 as Picard approaches. There is a small group of people gathered around a man -- BATAI, a genial-looking man in his 50's -- who is just finishing the planting of a sapling tree, tamping down the earth and then rising to address the group.
 Picard roams the hills beyond the town, searching for clues to his mysterious abduction. He climbs a small ridge, stares off in the distance, then climbs down and proceeds on his way.
 Eline sits at a small table, idly stirring soup in a bowl, when she hears something outside. She jumps up, goes to the door, activates it. Picard is standing there, bone-weary.
 It is a replica, an exact miniature, of the probe.
 It's... the first gift you ever gave me.
 as he stares at her.
 as Riker's cushioning hand finishes lowering Picard's head gently to the deck (in continuation of the action in progress during the instant we were last on the main bridge; as Picard was falling).
 Riker to sickbay. The captain's been hurt.
 Picard's inert form remains where it was on the deck, with Riker kneeling in close attendance. Geordi stands just behind him; Data, Worf and the Conn Officer still at stations -- as BEVERLY, with emergency medical equipment, rushes in from the forward turbolift to begin preliminary on-spot diagnosis.
 Reestablishing. The sapling has matured with five years of growth.
 Picard stands in the courtyard, holding a sextant and shooting the sun. He takes a measurement... then records his findings in a journal that's lying on a bench. Then he holds the instrument up to his eye again, continuing.
 who comes from the house and approaches Picard, who is absorbed in his work. She watches him silently for a moment, aware of his intense preoccupation. She moves toward him.
 He lowers the instrument, turns toward her. This is an old conversation.
 A group of the townspeople are gathered near the tree. The ADMINISTRATOR, a youngish man in an outfit which distinguishes him from the others, stands inspecting the tree. As Picard and Batai approach, he turns to them.
 Batai, beverage in hand, is sprawled on one of the benches; Picard is seated, barefoot, playing his flute. Not very well, and not any melody that we can recognize. But he's playing nonetheless, and it's a marked improvement from last time. He hits a couple of sour notes, and stops, working his fingers over the keys.
 as she emerges from within the home.
 Picard is still unconscious; more equipment is being set up by a MEDICAL TEAM including NURSE OGAWA and one other -- diagnostic apparatus, monitor, etc. Beverly hovers over Picard.
 FADE IN:
 The tree is now twelve years old. One of the N.D. Townfolk is watering it (sparingly) from a hand-held pot.
 It is seven years since we were last here. What was once the beautifully blossoming flower garden is now a rock garden. The entry door stands ajar. In the rock garden, an adorable little girl, MERIBOR, age six, plays happily. She's dressed in her best. We hear (o.s.) a lovely lullaby being played on a flute. The music continues thru into:
 It is an older Picard who stands playing the lovely lullaby. As he does, WIDEN to discover not only that he's playing to the infant son cradled (and rocked gently) in Eline's arms, but that Several N.D. Guests are present... gathered to watch, with smiling faces, this ritual ceremony. On a fairly long table set up for the occasion, are (as yet untouched) food snacks and stuff to drink for the guests. As the lullaby continues --
 Six year old Meribor, whom we've just seen outside, comes running into -- and part of the way through -- the room, before stopping to watch. She swings her arms a bit, and foot-fidgets (the way kids do who think they're standing in place), until stopped by:
 as a female guest comes and takes the baby from Eline. She and Picard are now momentarily alone.
 her face reflecting her silent, joyously contented knowledge of what he's experiencing.
 Another long beat... Now, suddenly, his face changes to a surprised grimace of pain.
 Eline Reacts to Picard's expression of pain. And, as he GRUNTS in still further pain, and clutches his left arm:
 Gasping for breath now, he goes first to his knees -- then to the floor on his back.
 Riker stands well back; Data and Worf at stations. Beverly is bent over Picard, frantically trying to revive him, Ogawa at her side. Picard begins to gasp for air.
 A lovely, intelligent-eyed girl, MERIBOR, (age sixteen, so another ten years have passed) kneels using a portable core sample-extraction device. Having taken a core sample, she'll now read it as the device measures its chemical content.
 He has just come from the house. We realize only slowly, as he grows nearer, that this is a Picard who
 Beverly and one of the medical team working over Picard, with Riker watching from behind them; Geordi at an aft science station; Data and Worf at stations.
 FADE IN:
 Reestablishing. The tree, though thirty-two years old, is now dead.
 Ten years have passed since we saw Picard last. He is peering through his telescope, occasionally entering data in his journal. Eline emerges from the house.
 Picard and the Administrator -- now having aged by twenty-seven years -- are in the square. Although some townspeople are seen in the B.G., they are alone. Picard carries his journal.
 He comes barreling toward them, out of breath, his face pale. Picard moves toward him.
 As Picard and Young Batai hurry in, a grim-faced Doctor is just rising from his inspection of Eline, who lies pale and blanket-covered on the chair. Picard goes to her.
 Picard, and all others, as we last saw them (with Beverly moving between her equipment and her patient) ...
 Still unconscious, breathing evenly... his features composed and even.
 A picture of frustration, pacing, staring out at the alien probe, stymied. Ogawa is studying the medical monitors.
 An eighty-five-year-old Picard (somewhat frail, bespectacled and slightly stooped) is on his hands and knees at the moment, playfully "chasing" a giggling six year old boy, KAMIE, around the large chair. Kamie is playing keep-away with Picard's old flute. Picard moves to begin tickling the boy.

 Picard and Meribor walk together toward a group which has collected in the square, all looking toward the sky in one direction.

 He's realized what that contrail is; what it represents.
 Now we live. In you. Tell them of us... my darling...
 as he stirs slightly.
 Picard has begun to regain consciousness. Beverly's working; Riker's standing by.
 Picard is alone, walking about his quarters as though reaquainting himself with these surroundings. The door CHIMES.
 Inside, rests Picard's old flute.
 as he lifts it from the box; nods his thanks to Riker, who, understanding that this is not a moment for words, acknowledges silently -- and EXITS.
 For a long beat, while the ship travels at impulse and end credits appear, we continue to hear the same, sweet lullaby.

 All we've been told is that evidence has been discovered indicating the presence of extraterrestrials on Earth... five centuries ago.
 PICARD and DATA move down a tunnel illuminated by mining lights... a SCIENTIST, male, late forties, leads the way...

 Riker is at a turbolift as Troi arrives... an acknowledgment and then...
 All three are facing forward. There is an uncomfortable beat of silence.
 Coming out of warp approaching a planet.
 Data, WORF, Riker. Picard ENTERS from the ready room.
 Sir, it is established procedure that the second officer accompanies the away...
 Ominous. Riker, Troi, Worf and Geordi MATERIALIZE... move around, investigating with tricorders... a natural rockface environment...
 Data at the aft science station. Picard at command.
 Moving to find Troi... who is walking with an inner purpose...
 Still in orbit.
 Picard reacts as...
 That explains a few things. How much, Data?

Data looks around, slowly rises... the alley is nondescript... but there are old style garbage cans... a cobblestone street surface... brick wall buildings. Data (who still has his phaser on his belt) moves slowly toward the street... reacts as he sees...
 a street scene out of San Francisco circa 1890s...
 Data continues to take in the 19th-century ambience. It's a cosmopolitan mixture of people and costumes. Two rough-looking DOCK WORKERS, three N.D. URBANITES, a pair of CHINESE IMMIGRANTS. He gets strong REACTIONS of curiosity re: his appearance.
 The paper is the SAN FRANCISCO REGISTER and the headline reads CHOLERA OUTBREAK -- HUNDREDS DIE. The date: AUGUST 13, 1893.

 A BELLBOY is loading a suitcase into a HORSEDRAWN CARRIAGE as the suitcase owner stands by. The man hands some coins to the Bellboy, then gets into the carriage. The Bellboy closes the door after him, and the carriage is driven off.
 heading over toward him, as the Bellboy steps over to two MEN who are standing at a doorway nearby. The Bellboy hands the coins over to one of them.
 A KNOCK. No response. A beat and the door opens, revealing Data, who steps inside. He looks up, sees what he came for.
 where the tension is palpable. No one has even glanced in Data's direction.
 I would like to join your game.
 A modest hotel room, with a single bed, a desk, and a window. The door UNLOCKS AND OPENS. The Bellboy ENTERS, holding out an arm as if to present the room -- and Data STEPS INSIDE.
 The Bellboy is shooting along the street, clutching Data's list in hand, smiling with enthusiasm over the money and the assignment.

 Picard, Riker, Troi, Geordi, Worf, BEVERLY. Cutting into the middle of a rare argument between Riker and Picard.
 After hours. The lighting is a little dimmer than normal. Two crewmembers at a far table are the only customers present.

 Data is at his desk, using a high-tech device he has built out of 19th-century materials. He is working on the exposed PHASER HOUSING. Data is now completely dressed in 19th-century clothing -- days have passed since we last saw him.

 A caption reads: "Literary Reception Announced." Above the words is the hostess' face. IT'S GUINAN. And it's unmistakable.

 To establish.
 An elegant reception. About two dozen well-dressed canapes.

 Riker, Troi, Geordi, Worf and Beverly... all participate in the preparation of the field... there is a variety of technical gear with them... one three-foot- high generator with controls and readouts, three two-foot-high relay stations akin to a small satellite receiver...

 a group of ALIENS in reclining positions on the ground, arranged loosely in a circle... each of them is silver-gray, a vaguely humanoid shape with very round heads, no facial features to speak of... except a blowhole where the forehead might ordinarily be... in their center, built into the ground, is a TRANSLUCENT HOLDING CHAMBER, glowing and flashing from within (like a light ball spinning inside). On the side of the chamber is a techno-organic, nipplelike projection. Periodically, the chamber DISPENSES an energy segment from its lower recesses... and as it emerges one of the aliens on a rotating basis sucks it into his blowhole...

 Two more aliens arriving through a hole of swirling white light... one carries a canister... the other a glowing, snakelike object... the noise is deafening...

 I have long been interested in the notion of time travel. In fact, I wrote a book about it... It chronicled the tale of a man from our era who fouled the sixth century by introducing newfangled gadgets and weapons... all in the name of Progress. The idea of time travelers isn't so far fetched as it seems... in fact, I have learned that, even now, people from the future are right here in San Francisco... and I have no doubt that they are intent on fouling our world... just like my Yankee did in King Arthur's time. Well. Let me serve notice: as soon as I get the necessary evidence, I intend to expose them... and make it absolutely clear that they are not welcome here.
 revealing that Clemens has been giving an on-the-street interview to a young reporter who is taking notes on a pad. The kid smiles politely.
 FADE IN:
 Only the vague shapes of drape-covered bodies are visible... a hand-held light (lantern?) casts a light. Beverly is using a tricorder on the bodies.
 Riker and Beverly are there, reporting to Picard, Troi, and Geordi. All are dressed in 19th century garb.
 I wouldn't do this for just anybody, Mister Clemens. And I hope you won't spread it around that I let you in...
 The transceiver assembly lies on the floor. Data stoops and picks it up. Clemens tries to regain his usual savoir faire.
 Riker (still as a policeman) strolls the street in front of the infirmary, cordially doffing his hat at various passersby.
 Beverly, dressed as a nurse, wearing wire-rimmed glasses, is following DOCTOR APOLLINAIRE as he makes rounds. He seems to be a kindly doctor, but underneath lie the typical assumptions of 19th century sexism and racism. In the bg, Troi and Geordi (with dark glasses), are passing out little parcels to patients, chatting with them as they do. Geordi is carrying the tray of parcels.
 No... had no family... only people to come were doctor and nurse.
 Riker continues his patrol as Picard approaches. He is dressed as a workman and carries a tool box.
 Picard is fiddling with one of the gas lamps on the wall. Glancing around to make sure no one is watching, he inserts a small (TECH DEVICE) inside the lamp, then begins to replace the fixture. Doctor Apollinaire approaches.
 as it opens and the tall, silent Alien Doctor and Nurse ENTER the ward. Beverly is working with the man at the other end of the room, her back toward them. The couple moves quickly to the bedside of a patient.

 Do you need any help, Doctor?
 Unseen by Beverly, the Alien Nurse puts both hands on the satchel...
 That's an interesting cane...
 grabs the cane with one hand and kicks the alien. The Alien Doctor reacts in rage, and lunges back toward Geordi; Riker gets off a phaser BLAST in between Geordi and the Alien Doctor, who stops in his tracks. He reaches out for the Alien Nurse and they --
 crackle with the blue EFFECT of phase-shifting and vanish. There is the SOUND of windows breaking. Our group looks around, stunned. It's all happened so fast. Outside, there are voices reacting to the commotion, shouting, etc. Some patients react.
 Data moves to his contraption, which is sounding an alarm, registering something like a seismograph. Data quickly unrolls a map and checks a location with the readings on the machine. Then he hurries for the door.
 An orderly runs in, followed by Doctor Apollinaire. (Geordi quickly removes his VISOR.)
 as they hurry out of the infirmary, they hear other police whistles blowing. Police are hurrying, on foot, toward them.
 Rushing toward them is a horse-drawn carriage driven by Data. The group reacts in amazement.

 as she walks toward the door, opens it and smiles at Mrs. Carmichael.
 Data, Riker, and Beverly are in a "rehearsal" of Midsummer Night's Dream; Picard is the director. He turns and, seeing Mrs. Carmichael, gestures grandly.
 The carriage in which the crew made their escape stands in front of the boarding house. The Alien Doctor and Nurse walk slowly toward it, look at it, and exchange glances... this is the one. Then they walk slowly on by.
 Guinan is there, pacing. She hears a key in the lock and whirls toward the door. It opens and Data ENTERS.
 Start on Clemens, standing among a few by-standers, chomping his cigar and listening to the end of a conversation.
 Geordi and Riker are in one tunnel of the cavern, using their tricorders.
 Picard, Troi, Beverly (glasses still in pocket), Data, and Guinan; all but the latter are scanning. Geordi and Riker join them.
 They activate the snake just as Data dives at them with his super speed -- he grabs for the snake just as it flares into action... there is a sonic boom and a hole of blinding white light begins to open -- right in Data's body.

 The Alien Nurse has been wounded and is lying on the ground. The Alien Doctor hesitates briefly... then plunges through the hole.
 stands up, staring at the time hole through which the others have vanished. He hesitates for an instant, glances at Picard, and then, as the hole is beginning to close, he dashes forward and jumps through. The hole closes. The cavern is quiet. Picard is now trapped in the 19th century.
 As seen in Part I, but not phase-shifted (i.e., we don't see the aliens or their environment.) The group is picking themselves up, shaking off the effects of the violent transport.
 The group, including Data's body, MATERIALIZES on the transporter pad. Clemens reacts to the experience... this has been quite a day for him...
 Picard is with Guinan... he has bandaged her head with material from her cape (or something). She is regaining consciousness... tries to sit up.
 Riker with Guinan at the bar.
 Clemens walking with Troi; she's been giving him a tour of the ship. A strange-looking alien passes them in the hall. Clemens stares, turns to look at him as he walks by.
 Deck thirty-six.
 Outside the Medical Lab.
 As they ENTER, they see Geordi has re-attached Data's body and four-hundred-year-old head.
 The alien nurse is stirring... phasing slightly from her human to her alien form because she is so badly injured. Picard goes toward her.
 FADE IN:
 Troi, Beverly, and Worf are there as Riker ENTERS briskly.
 Geordi is still tinkering with Data's head, which is attached to the body but not functioning.
 Guinan is unconscious; Picard checks Guinan's pulse and is satisfied that she is all right. He glances over and sees --

 considers it for a moment, and then walks over, picks it up. An idea occurs to him. He snaps open a panel in the back of the head and studies it.
 Riker, Worf, and N.D.'s as needed.
 Geordi speaks with mounting excitement.
 There's a little twitch... then another... then the hand clenches and unclenches.
 He sits up, looks around, and focuses on Geordi.
 Data, Geordi, Riker, and Beverly at the Aft Science Station.
 Guinan moans and stirs; Picard moves to her.
 Riker, Worf, others.

 Picard, groggy and disoriented, lies on the ground.
 O'Brien -- get him out of there!
 Picard, jarred by the explosion, is groggily awake... almost immediately, the transporter EFFECT shimmers on him -- and then there is an overwhelming EXPLOSION: the light is a brilliant white that completely wipes the screen.
 Transporter Room -- do you have him?
 warps off to continuing adventures.
 Picard ENTERS... spots Guinan behind the bar... walks to her and sits down. She gives him a smile... he smiles back. There are no words spoken, but the reunion of good friends is a poignant one. Over this:
 A pair of litter-bearers are carrying Guinan out of the cavern. Clemens looks down at her.

 PICARD, RIKER, DATA, WORF and SUPERNUMERARIES at their stations. There is a sense of urgency in the air.
 GEORDI is at his controls, REGINALD BARCLAY a couple of panels down; other N.D. ENGINEERS are also working.
 Riker, Worf and BEVERLY ENTER. Geordi and O'BRIEN are working the console. A few feet away, Barclay has a wall panel open and is re-working isolinear chips -- he looks distracted by something. Riker stops at Geordi and O'Brien.
 as the process begins again. He watches, trying to stay calm... but every detail of the process -- every sight and sound -- seems to intensify his discomfort.
 TROI is talking to Barclay, who looks depressed by recent events. He's moving around the room, picking up objects and setting them down, anything to take the weight off of the moment. Troi tries to reassure him.
 trapped inside the gaseous layers of the plasma streamer.
 The darkened room is heavily DAMAGED, as if by an explosion. Charred black walls... overturned equipment... no sign of a crew. Beverly is searching the room... Geordi is studying a damaged console as Riker and Worf ENTER from an adjoining corridor, having completed a search of the science station.
 O'Brien is staring doubtfully at the person standing next to him.
 (Transporter Room side) partially phased, the room behind him becoming SPARKLES OF ENERGY. For the first time, we are seeing what it feels like to transport. Barclay winces at the awful experience, but keeps his eyes open, looking around, alert the entire time. After a few seconds, we see Barclay himself start to PHASE OUT, as his body is broken down into molecules...
 as O'Brien and the Transporter Room DISSOLVE away into sparkles of energy. The SPARKLES momentarily fill the entire field of view... then DISSOLVE out to reveal the SCIENCE SHIP SET, with Geordi standing nearby...

 Geordi and Barclay set the metal fragments onto the Transporter stage. Riker, Worf and Beverly are not present, having already beamed back to the ship. Barclay steps down off the stage.
 O'Brien at the controls. Riker stands nearby, having just returned.
 Geordi DEMATERIALIZES. Barclay is now left alone. He steps onto the Transporter stage... braces himself... slightly more confident than the last time...
 (Science ship side) as the room DISSOLVES INTO SPARKLES OF ENERGY. Barclay tenses up, hating every second of it. The SPARKLES fill the entire frame except for Barclay... and we see Barclay start to PHASE OUT...
 as the science ship begins to DISSOLVE AWAY into sparkles... Partially obscured by the sparkles of energy is a MOVING SHAPE. It quickly crosses toward us, more visible now -- an amorphous cloud of energy. As it flies closer, the cloud momentarily takes on a more life-like form -- a gaping funnel opens in the cloud, like a distorted and voracious mouth. Terrifying.
 (Transporter Room side) is beginning to PHASE BACK IN. He reacts. And it all happens at once: The creature FLIES at him -- Barclay throws up an arm to protect himself -- and the creature makes contact with his arm just as the Transporter Room dissolves into view --
 Barclay completes his MATERIALIZATION on stage, his arm still in the air, expression blank with shock. O'Brien looks up from his console and gives him a smile.
 holding position at the plasma streamer.
 Geordi and Barclay are at a console monitor, scanning logs. Barclay seems distracted -- he hasn't told anyone about the creature he saw in the Transporter. But the emotional impact of the experience is still with him... and it's nagging at him...
 One of the lighted circles on the Transporter platform is opened, and the inner-workings have been raised out in a column. O'Brien is kneeling on the stage, analyzing the circuits. From the looks of it, he's been running a Transporter diagnostic for the past couple of hours. He stands up and looks to Geordi, who's working at an opened wall panel with Barclay.
 Beverly and NURSE OGAWA are performing an AUTOPSY on Lieutenant Kelly, the dead male crewmember. The body is laid out under the clamshell. Ogawa watches a nearby MONITOR, which displays various data.
 Barclay ENTERS and stops at the bar. A BARTENDER walks over.
 of his arm, as it RADIATES with a SPARKLING LIGHT in the exact same spot where the creature touched him -- a vague impression, like a smudge. The light vanishes just as quickly.
 As Barclay reacts, startled by the sight. He glances around the room -- no one has seen the vision but him. Barclay starts to say something, thinks better of it, and says nothing, deciding to conceal what he's seen. OFF his troubled expression...
 FADE IN:
 Barclay ENTERS, looking troubled and shaken. He absently rubs his left arm, then crosses to a replicator slot.
 Picard, Riker, Geordi, Data. Beverly is reporting.
 at the plasma streamer.
 Geordi, Barclay and Data are examining the metal fragments (as seen in Act One) -- but now the fragments have been roughly put together to form a matter sample container. Barclay looks exhausted, barely able to focus on the task at hand.
 Geordi walks up to Barclay.
 Barclay quickly EXITS. Geordi and Data exchange a glance.
 Barclay is briskly walking down the corridor at a steady clip -- oblivious to everything and everyone around him. He's in his own world. Follow Barclay as he walks... turns a corner... passes a curious crewmember... walking... walking...
 The lights are dim. Several candles are burning. Barclay is lying on the floor in a contorted Yoga position. He is deep breathing, letting out his breath in drawn-out vocalizations. The SOUND of chirping BIRDS and gently falling RAIN can be heard playing over the Com system. Barclay is desperately trying to relax.
 is RADIATING with the SPARKLING LIGHT (as seen in Act Two). Only this time, the glowing imprint has spread to include his shoulder and neck. Barclay cries out, jumps out of bed. The glow VANISHES.
 Barclay is at the console, studying a read-out of the transport logs. O'Brien ENTERS, looking like he just woke up.
 (Transporter Room side) as the room DISSOLVES INTO SPARKLES OF ENERGY. Barclay looks around, searching for any sign of movement. The SPARKLES fill the entire frame except for Barclay... and we see Barclay start to PHASE OUT...
 as the science ship set DISSOLVES into view... then back to sparkles... the MOVING SHAPE from Act One is moving amidst the shimmering energy... visible now as the amorphous cloud.
 (Transporter Room side) Barclay begins to PHASE BACK IN. He sees the creature, fearful. The creature flies toward him, purposeful, its distorted mouth widening -- closer and closer and closer...
 As Barclay MATERIALIZES. A beat as he takes in what he's seen. Then he steps down off the platform with renewed conviction.
 Picard, Riker, Worf, Geordi, Troi. Barclay is sitting at the head of the table, speaking to the group. He is uncomfortable, but determined to make his case. Beverly is standing beside him, taking tricorder scans of his left arm.
 Barclay sitting on a bio-bed. Beverly is moving a special medical DEVICE over Barclay's left arm. She moves the device up his arm... around his shoulder... and over his neck... then above his chest. Barclay is getting worried.
 Geordi and Data are preparing an empty SAMPLE CONTAINER. Barclay is at a nearby console.
 Barclay is sitting on a bio-bed, tired and edgy. Beverly, Geordi and Data are standing nearby. Mid-conversation.
 Barclay ENTERS. Beverly is with him, medical gear at-the-ready. Geordi and O'Brien are working at the console.
 Your pattern might degrade to the point where your signal would be permanently lost.
 Barclay ENTERS. Beverly is with him, medical gear at-the-ready. Geordi and O'Brien are working at the console.
 (Transporter Room side) The world around him DISSOLVES into SPARKLES OF ENERGY -- the Transporter Room barely visible against the shimmering light. Barclay tries to stay calm and motionless... a second passes... then Barclay starts to PHASE OUT...
 Continuous. Geordi and O'Brien working, tense. Beverly works a nearby console.
 Continuous. Barclay's body stays in a SEMI-PHASED state, sparkling energy all around. Several seconds go by. Barclay sees something --
 of the familiar MOVING SHAPE coming toward us -- it's the LIFE FORM.
 Continuous.
 Continuous. Barclay terrified as the life form comes closer and closer, snaking through the streaks of energy, its distorted body and mouth-like orifice barely discernible. Barclay doesn't move, stares wide-eyed at the thing as it stops just inches from his face...
 Continuous. Tension building...
 (Transporter side) Continuous. Barclay gaping at the life form. The thing hovers there for a moment. Then it starts to tilt and move its body, as if trying to communicate -- like it's supplicating. And it should be clear at this close range that there is something vaguely human about this creature -- it seems to be asking for something...
 Continuous. Barclay is just starting to MATERIALIZE on the platform -- he appears to be holding onto something, his arms wrapped around it, but we can't quite make out what it is...
 as Barclay PHASES IN AND OUT for a second... then MATERIALIZES all the way. HE IS HOLDING A HUMAN BEING Reactions. Beverly rushes to their aid.

 Troi ENTERS the Transporter Room. The Transporter TECHNICIAN works the console and AMBASSADOR ALKAR and his mother MAYLOR MATERIALIZE.

 Deck nine. If I were empathic, like you... I'd have a real advantage.
 Tell me, Counselor... have you ever been involved in diplomatic negotiations?
 The chime SOUNDS.
 Riker and Troi ENTER. BEVERLY has two Med Techs there; they are already into life-saving procedures on Maylor, who lies sprawled on the floor, unconscious. Troi moves to Alkar, who is pale and drained, staring at the form on the floor.
 Alkar is opening a small, ornate box. He opens the box and takes out a few oddly shaped chunks of dark ore, gives one to Troi.
 Captain...
 Troi sits on a couch, curled up and reading. But she seems unable to concentrate. Her eyes drift away from the book and she stares into space. Then, the door CHIMES. She rises and crosses to it, it opens. Alkar stands there. He carries a small, ornate box.

 to a full shot. She tugs gently at various points of her uniform but can't seem to get comfortable. She opens a drawer and rifles through her clothes, but summarily decides against all of them. There is an edge to her movements that suggests a profound dissatisfaction.
 Picard ENTERS to find Beverly near a stasis tube which holds the body of Alkar's dead mother.
 Troi is alone, performing Tai Chi exercises, watching her form in the mirror. Her movements are slow, controlled; the edge we saw in the previous scene seems to have been vented off.
 Troi stands in the doorway to his quarters, her skin flushed, her hair in some disarray... her gi still slightly undone. Alkar smiles at her.
 Troi is alone, trying to sort out her feelings. The lift stops to let someone in: a YOUNG ENSIGN in his late-twenties. He nods at her and turns to face the door.

 as Riker steps in to the main room and sees, in the bedroom, the young Ensign sitting on the edge of Troi's bed putting on his boots. His eyes fairly pop out of his head when he sees Riker and he instinctively stands at attention.
 as we follow him out. He shakes his head in puzzlement, not understanding Troi's behavior... but chalking it up to her own embarrassment because he's caught her in flagrante.
 In orbit around Seronia.
 Alkar and Picard are with JARTH, a heavy-set man in his mid-fifties, and LIVA, a lovely woman in her thirties, with the delicate features of a porcelain doll. There is a map displayed on the monitor. Jarth addresses both Picard and Alkar.
 Troi is with ENSIGN JANEWAY, a young woman from the science department, who is very distraught.
 Beverly is looking on as Geordi enters data into the console.
 The ship is still in orbit.
 A casual mingling is underway. Data is here some distance away and out of earshot. Alkar is in conversation with Jarth and Liva. Riker ENTERS. He moves to Alkar.
 As Troi ENTERS the room and we see a startling change in the Counselor.
 As Troi moves through the room, Data and Riker stare at her.
 as she moves toward Alkar and his group. Riker stares at her, amazed at the transformation.
 Riker, holding Troi by the arm, is moving Troi down the corridor at a brisk pace. He is keeping his voice down here in public.
 Riker and Troi ENTER from the corridor. Riker releases her the moment they're inside the room.
 Troi stands facing away from camera; the door chimes.
 Beverly is examining the scratches on Riker's face and neck with a scanner.
 Picard ENTERS. Alkar, Jarth and Liva are on the Transporter platform, ready to beam down to the surface. A TRANSPORTER CHIEF, stands ready behind the console.
 She ENTERS behind Picard. There is an overwhelming sense of depravity about her. Troi's hair is now completely white, her craggy flesh completing her horrific transformation.
 She is in a biobed contained by a restraining force field. Troi is struggling to get free and the force field is activated when she touches it.

 Picard is alone in the room with Alkar. Alkar speaks of Troi and Maylor calmly, matter of factly, as if he were talking about pieces of machinery.
 The Enterprise in orbit.

 People are in a jubilant mood. Alkar, Jarth, and Liva are there. As they talk, people come by, patting them on the back, shaking hands, etc.
 Picard is in his command chair, grim-faced and urgent.
 The ship in orbit.
 Alkar and Liva, accompanied by Worf, ENTER. Alkar's anxiety has increased slightly and he is no longer the serene diplomat we've seen previously. He stops short once he sees...
 Beverly is just removing a medical device from Troi's forehead. Troi now looks ghastly... she has aged as far as did Maylor when she died. A clearly grief-stricken Riker is standing near Picard who looks grim. Beverly's voice is bitter as she looks up at Alkar.
 He moves to the couch, looks at her, his shaky emotions once more put forth as a grief response.
 Beverly, Ogawa, checking Troi's lifesigns and getting ready to revive her.
 Liva and Alkar hold the stones... Alkar's eyes are closed... he begins the meditation.
 We can't wait any longer. Release the stasis field. Ten cc's of cordrazine.

 Alkar gasps, suddenly confused... he reaches out and grabs Liva.
 Is surprised by his action.
 Who looks much older. He grabs Liva and refuses to let go.

 Alkar has aged still more. He holds a struggling Liva in his grip.
 As Troi continues to get younger and younger...
 Beverly and Picard react to this unexpected news with surprise. But Riker cares only about Troi, pale and weary, but otherwise just fine. She reaches out for his hand.

 Riker with Troi, relaxing with coffee or tea.
 The ship in orbit.
 The ship is moving at warp speed.
 DATA is working at the aft science station. PICARD and RIKER are standing nearby, WORF is at Tactical, and ENSIGN RAGER is at Con. The monitor at the science station shows an Okudagram of a subspace radio wave.
 The viewer displays a starfield with a large dark ball at the center. At this distance, it appears as smooth as a billiard ball, but because it is so dark it's hard to discern anything else.
 The ship is nearing the Sphere. At this range, the monstrous object looks like a giant WALL in space, which stretches o.c. Where before, the sphere appeared perfectly smooth, we can now make out intricate patterns on the surface suggesting construction supports, but again we're too far away to make out anything distinct.
 As before. Everyone watching the viewscreen.
 The transport ship has made a crash landing on the surface of the sphere. There should be some damage visible, but not so much that the ship would be incapable of later flight.
 The Ops center is fairly small with a modest command area at one end and an engineering console at the opposite end. Off to one side is a two-man Transporter stage and control panel. The ship's technology and design should be noticeably older than the Enterprise and should reflect outdated engineering methods and philosophy.
 An OLD-STYLE TRANSPORTER EFFECT begins... a figure wavers in the beam for a moment... finally solidifies and CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY SCOTT MATERIALIZES in front of a shocked Riker & Geordi.
 Continuous action from the Teaser. Riker and Geordi are staring at Scott on the Transporter stage. Scott looks a little woozy... unsure of his bearings, then he seems to shake it off and he moves toward them with a plan of action. His left arm is in a sling and he has one or two cuts and bruises visible.
 as Scott turns around at the sound of Worf's voice. Scott stares at him with unabashed shock.
 The ship next to the mammoth sphere.
 Riker, Worf, Scott and Geordi MATERIALIZE on the Transporter stage. There is a N.D. TRANSPORTER TECHNICIAN at the controls. Scott is fascinated by everything he sees here... like a kid in a new and unimagined candy shop. The other three step off the platform, but Scott stays behind and looks up at the overhead Transporter machinery.
 Scott and Geordi ENTER from Transporter Room and head down the corridor. Scott's eyes are continually scanning every inch of the corridor. Occasionally he stops to examine something.
 Scott is sitting on one of the biobeds and BEVERLY is running a medical device over his injured arm. His bruises are already gone. Geordi is nearby.
 As before.
 KANE is pointing out the features of the room to Scott.
 Geordi is working in his office while SEVERAL N.D. ENGINEERS move about the room, working consoles and checking displays. Geordi is talking to an Engineer
 The graphic shows a cut-away view of the sphere, revealing a STAR at the center, and a thin ATMOSPHERE clinging to the interior of the sphere itself.
 Scott and Geordi are working at the pool table. Scott's attitude is cheerful and excited, but in his effort to be helpful he's really straining Geordi's patience. (In the b.g., the warp core is OFF.)
 As before.
 Scott is still a little churned up by the blow-up with Geordi. He fumes and paces about the room.
 Scott ENTERS and looks around. He smiles at the scene... somehow this is more to his liking. He sits down at the bar and a WAITER comes over to him. Data is seated at a bar stool nearby.
 Scott is standing just outside the Holodeck doors. He's still carrying the green bottle and glass from Ten Forward and he's a little drunk. He activates the bulkhead computer terminal.
 Scott stops in the middle of the old Bridge and looks around... and for a moment, the look on his face says he's come home. But without people manning the consoles and stations, this is like being aboard a ghost ship. Scott goes over to his old station on the Bridge (at the back of the Bridge to the right of the Turbolift) and sits down.
 As he pours himself a stiff drink. A look of melancholy settles over his features... he's sad and lonely. He lifts his glass in salute to the people who aren't here.
 After a moment, there is the SOUND of the Holodeck doors opening and closing from o.c. Scott looks up to see that Picard has entered and is nearing the command center.
 As before.
 Picard is sitting at his desk. The door CHIMES.
 Geordi ENTERS from Ready Room and then EXITS to a Turbolift. Riker in Command, Data at Ops.
 Geordi is standing near the platform, waiting with an equipment case. After a few beats Scott ENTERS. He looks somewhat worse for wear and a little bleary-eyed.
 The ship moves on impulse power.
 Picard and Worf have now joined Riker and Data on the Bridge. The viewscreen is showing a close shot of the surface of the sphere. There is a LARGE CIRCLE on the metallic exterior with several small DISH ANTENNAS around the perimeter of the circle.
 We see the circle now SLIDE ASIDE, revealing that it is actually a giant hatch on the surface of the sphere. A star can be seen inside the sphere as the Enterprise hurtles toward the hatch.
 We can now see that the ship is being pulled down by a series of THREE BEAMS which emanate from points surrounding the hatch. The ship is pulled INSIDE the sphere by the beams and then the hatch SLIDES CLOSED, trapping the ship.
 As before. The Bridge is SHAKING and the lights are DIM. The main viewer shows the atmosphere rushing past, with a glowing SUN directly ahead.
 The ship is inside the sphere, still being propelled forward by the tractor beams seen earlier.
 As before.
 The ship is still crashed on the surface of the sphere.
 Scott is using a few of his tools on an open panel and the old-style interior can be seen as he works. Geordi has attached a large DEVICE from his equipment case to a console and it BLINKS and FLASHES in response to Scott's work. Scott seems a little subdued.
 As before. The main viewer shows the star getting bigger and bigger. There is still a sense of urgency in the air. Riker has activated the aft Engineering station and is working on it.
 The giant image of the star gradually shifts to the left as the ship manages to turn away.
 As before.
 Scott and Geordi are working on two consoles. Geordi is very concerned.
 Data and Picard are at one of the aft science stations.
 The screen shows a HUGE SOLAR FLARE reaching out from the star and heading directly toward the Enterprise.
 FADE IN:
 Scott and Geordi are lying on the deck with only their legs sticking out of two consoles. Various tools and devices are scattered around them.
 The ship is still in orbit around the star. A HUGE SOLAR FLARE billows up behind the ship... part of the flaming plasma brushes against the shields of the Enterprise.
 Picard, Data, Worf, and Rager at their stations. The ship ROCKS.
 The Jenolen is in orbit above the same circular hatch that the Enterprise saw earlier.
 Scott and Geordi are looking at a monitor which shows a view of the same portal that the Enterprise saw earlier.
 The ship is moving on impulse power and it comes to a stop in space. The sphere is o.c.
 Scott and Geordi are at the controls.
 The hatch SLIDES OPEN as seen earlier. From around the circumference of the circle, THREE BEAMS reach up into space and search for a ship... but find nothing.
 As before. Geordi and Scott watching their consoles.
 The pilot beams fail to grasp onto anything... and finally SHUT OFF. The hatch now begins to SLIDE CLOSED.
 As before.
 The Jenolen moves into the middle of the doorway as the hatch is closing and then STOPS. Suddenly the hatch encounters the DEFLECTOR SHIELD of the Jenolen and the hatch STOPS. (The shield is only visible when it hits the hatch.)
 Picard, Worf, Data, and Rager at their stations.
 As before. The ship is SHAKING and the engines are ROARING with the strain as Scott works in the b.g.
 The ship is still stuck in the hatch.
 As before. There is a sudden VIOLENT SHAKE, and one of the panels EXPLODES. Scott rushes over to check the damage.
 As before.
 The Enterprise is heading into the atmosphere and toward the distant open hatch.
 As before.
 As before. The ship is falling apart... SHAKING badly... consoles starting to SPARK and EXPLODE... the lighting is FLICKERING... and the engine noise is a SHRIEK of overworked metal.
 As before.
 The Enterprise is racing toward the fast closing hatch.
 The crew reacts to the sight of the closing hatch on the main viewer.
 The hatch is almost closed... but then at the last second the Enterprise ROLLS 90 degrees to port and SLIPS THROUGH the doorway ON ITS SIDE just as the hatch SLAMS SHUT.
 Scott and Geordi are just stepping off the platform.
 The ship at impulse power.
 Scott and Geordi are walking toward the shuttlebay. For once, Scott is listening to Geordi tell a tall tale and they're both in good spirits.
 Geordi and Scott ENTER from the Corridor. Scott is surprised by what he sees.
 Revealing Picard, Riker, Worf, Beverly, Troi, and Data all standing next to a LARGE SHUTTLECRAFT. Scott is stunned as he looks over the gleaming ship.
 The shuttle leaves the ship and the two fly off in different directions.
 at impulse in a vast and starry region.
 RIKER is lying in bed, just starting to wake up. He lies there a moment, groggy, staring into middle distance... then finally sits up. Every move is a struggle. He swings his legs over the bed... rubs his hands over his face... yawns... he just can't get going...
 Riker enters and activates the sink. He splashes cold water onto his face, then looks at his tired face in the mirror...
 GEORDI and DATA are working at a console; LIEUTENANT SHIPLEY and VARIOUS ND'S also present. A console monitor displays a MAP of the AMARGOSA DIASPORA.
 Later. Data is giving his poetry reading to a small audience, including Riker, Geordi, PICARD, TROI, WORF and KAMINER (A FEMALE CIVILIAN).

 Riker sitting on an examination table, looking fatigued. Beverly scans him with a medical tricorder.
 Geordi and Data are working at a console; Lieutenant Shipley and N.D.s also present. Geordi looks excited by their work -- this is an important moment for him.
 ON THE MOVE with Worf and ONE SECURITY N.D. running along, emergency gear in-tow. They converge outside the CARGO BAY FOUR doors, where Geordi, Data and Shipley are already taking tricorder scans. Beverly and TWO MEDICAL N.D.s arrive a second later, with a gurney and various medical gear.
 Continuous. Worf and the security N.D.'s rush in -- and stop at what they see. Geordi and the others quickly follow, and also react to the sight --
 The THREE CREWMEMBERS are carrying a piece of equipment, stopped in mid-stride, staring back at Worf and the others with looks of utter surprise. They are unharmed. The Cargo Bay is undamaged. There has been no explosion. Nothing is wrong.
 Later. Riker and Geordi walking along, mid-conversation.
 Riker dressed in his nightclothes, ready for bed, standing at a replicator slot. Offscreen, we HEAR a glass of warm milk MATERIALIZE. He picks up the glass, takes a sip, winces at the taste.
 The door CHIMES. Riker opens his eyes, groggy. Did he hear something? The door CHIMES again.
 MOT the Barber is with a colleague. Worf ENTERS. Mot turns, sees Worf and his face drops -- he's not pleased to see the intimidating Klingon. Worf fixes him with a baleful look, as Mot nervously tries to make Worf welcome.
 as he reacts to the adjustment -- for some reason, the movement of the chair is making him uneasy.
 as they move toward Worf. The light glints off the shiny metal blades...
 grabs Mot's wrist, as if in self-defense. For some reason, the scissors have struck a primal chord in Worf.
 Riker and Geordi are looking at an opened PANEL on the bulkhead -- a cluster of circuitry is exposed. Geordi is tracing the circuitry with a tricorder...
 Geordi's VISOR is off. Beverly scans a medical tricorder across the blinking terminal points on either side of Geordi's head.
 Geordi ENTERS. Data is working at the console, in the same position as he was when Geordi left him in the previous Cargo Bay scene.
 Riker, N.D.s, and ENSIGN RAGER at Conn. Riker is in his chair, looking at his armchair console, still fighting fatigue.
 as he sits down at the Conn behind the console...
 VARIOUS ND ENGINEERS are scanning and inspecting the large room. Geordi is working the console; Data and Lieutenant Shipley are working nearby.
 A small section of the wall is PULSATING -- as if the metal itself has come alive, and is undulating in perpetual waves -- rippling.
 Data and Geordi reporting to Picard. Shipley is working nearby. They are standing near the altered bulkhead, which continues to PULSATE.
 Riker and Troi sitting at a table, mid-conversation. Riker is weary and frustrated, struggling to find the right words...
 at impulse.
 Troi, Riker, Worf, Geordi and Kaminer (the civilian seen in the Teaser) sitting in a semi-circle. Troi is leading the discussion. There is a sense of uneasiness in the room.
 The room is bare, except for the familiar GRID. Riker, Worf, Geordi and Kaminer are there, standing around the room... each of them looking inward, trying to remember. Troi stands off to one side, lending guidance to the others.
 Tetryons... the same particles in the Cargo Bay...

 Geordi and Data ENTER. Lieutenant Shipley turns to them, concerned.
 Visible in the middle of the room is a tiny TEAR IN SPACE, swirling, distorting the area around it.

 as he opens his tricorder and moves to the same PULSATING wall we saw in Act Three. The wall is worse
 standing a few feet away from the tear in space, scanning it. Geordi stops next to him -- he motions to the spatial rupture.
 Picard, Riker, Worf, N.D.s. Picard and Riker are at the aft science station, studying a GRAPHIC of various sensor logs.
 ON THE MOVE with Beverly, running down the hall. She reaches a door and taps the control pad next to it. No response.
 Picard, Riker, Data, Troi, Geordi, Beverly, Worf. Picard is pacing, restless -- he's unnerved by the helplessness he feels at the situation.
 Geordi, Beverly, Riker. Geordi is making a few adjustments to a tricorder. Beverly injects Riker with a hypospray. Riker shakes his head, feeling lightheaded.
 Later. Riker alone, on his back, lying in bed, eyes open, unable to sleep. He's in uniform, a phaser attached to his waist and a tricorder in his hand. The homing device armband is strapped to his left arm. (Note: the tricorder is active). A quiet moment passes by as he lies there, waiting...
 CLOSE ON RIKER, who carefully opens his eyes, disoriented -- where is he? He steals a look at the strange surroundings, testing the situation... all the while, trying to appear as though he is semi-conscious...
 Geordi is working in his office. Shipley and several N.D. are working in the b.g. The situation is tense. Picard ENTERS and crosses to Geordi.
 Data is working the freestanding console. Visible in the middle of the room, the tear in space is LARGER... swirling... distorting the space around it...
 Picard turns to Geordi.
 Riker watches furtively as an alien figure crosses the room to Rager... stoops over her and begins to do something to her that we cannot see. We HEAR Rager moan, as though in pain...
 Suddenly, the small LIGHT on the homing device starts to FLASH. Riker takes note... the alien does not see it...
 A small ALARM is sounding. Geordi reacts to his console.
 Riker still on the table, feigning semi-consciousness; homing device still flashing. He watches as another alien figure approaches and stops at the table. An alien hand comes into the light and touches a control on the console over Riker's chest. The console automatically raises off of Riker's chest, freeing him...
 Data working. LIGHT from the rupture FLASHING.
 As before. Tension building.
 Data is working.
 Concern. Geordi reacting to various console information.
 Riker watches from the table. The alien figures are working the console, clicking and chattering, unhappy about something. Clearly, they have more important things to do than worry about Riker, who they believe is sedated.

 Tension building.
 The rupture is still looking out into the Enterprise Cargo Bay, like a window. Suddenly, the room SHAKES. The rupture shudders, starts to get smaller -- closing down. The alien figures react, unhappy with the situation.
 As before.
 The room SHAKES again. Riker decides to take the opportunity while the Aliens are distracted. Slowly, he steps off the table... pauses... glances at the aliens...
 The rupture is ninety-six percent closed.
 As before. The room SHAKES violently. Finally, Riker picks up Rager and the alien instrument -- gathers them over his shoulder and, with great effort, starts to carry them across the room, in the direction of the spatial rupture...
 IN A FLASH OF LIGHT, Riker and Rager VANISH into the rupture --
 Data reacts to a FLASH OF LIGHT that occurs offscreen having just come through the rupture -- they slump to the floor.
 As the rupture starts to close down, an ALIEN SHAPE EMERGES -- a huge COIL OF ENERGY which snakes out of the rupture -- quick and violent -- then across the Cargo Bay and through the wall out into space...
 as the strange COIL OF ENERGY EMERGES through the hull of the ship, and flies off into space.
 The spatial rupture is gone. Silence. Riker and Data exchange a look. What the hell was that? As they stare at the Cargo Bay wall, mystified...

 Picard, Riker, Data, Geordi.
 holding position near a starbase.
 Welcome to the Enterprise. We're delighted to have you aboard.
 to include BEVERLY and eighteen-year-old AMANDA ROGERS.
 as Riker and Amanda make their way down it. She walks with downcast eyes, stricken with shyness in front of the dashing First Officer. Riker smiles to himself, decides to try and put her at ease.
 Amanda looks around, seems a little surprised.
 Amanda's room is suddenly full of PUPPIES... a dozen of them, yapping and wagging their tails. Amanda's hand flies to cover her mouth in dismay.
 Beverly is showing Amanda the readout dials on a medical TRICORDER.

 The place is buzzing with activity. NDs bustle around packing crates and loading them into the SHUTTLECRAFT.
 on the railing of the overhang. It suddenly moves forward, as though of its own volition, and teeters on the edge of the stack.
 as her eye is caught by the movement. Then, the case shifts forward again and begins FALLING right toward Riker. There isn't even time to shout a warning...
 Amanda is alone in her quarters, mulling over the strange events of the past few days. If only there was someone she could talk to about it all. But what if they thought she was a freak? They used to burn witches!

 as Geordi and Amanda cross away from the warp core toward the pool table, where DATA is working.
 favoring Amanda, with the pulsing reactor behind her.
 Picard, Riker, Geordi, and Troi look up as Beverly ENTERS.
 There. Isn't that better? Doctor Crusher gets more shrill with each passing year...
 as Picard crosses to Data.
 Beverly and Amanda are sitting together on the couch. Though she is still grappling with the enormous implications of what she's been told, the news does explain certain things that have been happening.
 Picard is with Q; he's irate at Q's behavior. Q is vaguely listening; he fussily brushes and tugs at his uniform, as if it had been mussed in his fall.
 Beverly is with Amanda, still upset after the incident with Q.
 Q walks along the corridor on his way to Amanda's quarters. No one is around. Suddenly a DARK SHADOW appears on the wall ahead of him. Q stops, annoyed. We HEAR the voice of the shadow... it is futzed and sepulchral.
 as Q walks toward Amanda's quarters. He stops outside the door, takes a breath, and starts to walk through the door. Then he checks himself and, with a grimace, makes himself push the control.
 as she hears the chime.
 as it cruises at impulse.
 Beverly is walking Amanda through the various steps involved in the neural tissue experiment she's been working on.
 Data is working at an Aft Science Station. Picard ENTERS from the Ready Room and approaches Riker, who is in his chair.
 Riker ENTERS and stops when he sees Q and Amanda. Q is standing in front of her... her eyes are closed, as though concentrating on something. The minute Q sees Riker --
 Data is once more at the Aft Science Station.
 Amanda with Q.
 as Amanda REAPPEARS amidst the bustle of activity in the room. A few people notice her but she ignores them as she looks around for Q.
 as Amanda APPEARS in the area between the pool table and the warp core.
 as Amanda APPEARS and is stunned to find herself standing on the ship's hull -- she has materialized outside, in space, atop the saucer section.
 as Q and Amanda APPEAR. She is still breathless with the wonder of what she has experienced. Q gazes at her, well aware of the impact of his little game.

 Amanda is with Picard, who has told her of Q's true purpose. She is pale but composed.
 as they emerge from the Ready Room. Riker is on the viewscreen from the reactor control room. Geordi and Lote are in bg.
 Through all this, she has been staring at the Viewscreen, stricken with the possibility of what might happen.
 as Riker and Geordi stand there, helpless... then, from the back of the control room...

 The brown veil over the planet is dissipating... and Tagra is transformed into a lush, blue-green world...
 stares at the phenomenal transformation.
 A lonely craft against a starry background.
 PICARD, GUINAN, KEIKO and RO are in the back of the shuttle, relaxing. The atmosphere is very informal. Picard is still energized by his recent trip and is showing Guinan some odd pieces of pottery from a small box.
 Ro is looking at the collection of bagged plants that Keiko is holding in a small tray.
 The shuttle is confronted by a bright FLASH that erupts directly in the craft's path. The light quickly fades leaving only an incandescent CLOUD-LIKE ANOMALY in its wake.
 There's a sudden JOLT and the craft begins to SHAKE, caught in the grip of some phenomenon.
 The ship at impulse power.
 RIKER, DATA, and WORF at their stations, various SUPERNUMERARIES.
 Red alert... all power gone... the SHAKING is really VIOLENT now.
 O'Brien working feverishly at the controls.
 A low angle looking up at O'Brien from the POV of the Transporter platform. He reacts with shock to what he sees.
 Revealing that the entire shuttle crew has now been turned into twelve year old children. YOUNG PICARD, YOUNG RO, YOUNG GUINAN, and YOUNG KEIKO all wear the same clothes the adults wore in the shuttle, but now they're a few sizes too big for them. For a split second, Young Picard is unaware of what's happened. (NOTE: Young Keiko is now carrying a tray of sprouted seedlings.)
 BEVERLY, medical tricorder in hand, finishes her examination of Young Picard. Troi is with her. In the b.g., Young Ro, Young Guinan and Young Keiko sit on biobeds while an N.D. conducts tests with a tricorder. NOTE: "child" versions now wear smaller, replicated clothes, with normal sized insignias. They are still examining the fit of their new clothes.
 Young Ro sits on her biobed obviously not pleased with any of this. She opens and closes her fingers, not quite able to realize that these are now her hands. Young Guinan is more serene as usual and seems to be taking this all with a slight air of amusement. She studies Young Ro for a beat, who finally notices.
 Riker and Young Picard ENTER.
 Data, GEORDI, and Worf are at their stations along with N.D. Crewmembers. Young Picard and Riker ENTER from the Turbolift. Young Picard moves directly to Worf, who looks down with astonishment at his captain.
 Beverly and the young Captain ENTER. Young Picard is in charge, trying to continue on in his normal fashion. He moves to the replicator.
 As before. Young Picard and Beverly ENTER from the Ready Room. He goes directly to Riker and there is no trace of hesitation or regret at his decision.
 Young Ro and Young Guinan ENTER from Sickbay. Young Ro is very irritated as they pause in the Corridor.
 Young Keiko and O'Brien sit on the couch. There is a long, awkward silence between them as they struggle to make sense of the situation.
 MOLLY is lying in her bed as O'Brien and Young Keiko ENTER.
 Young Keiko is fighting back tears as O'Brien ENTERS.
 The ship drops out of warp.
 Young Picard is looking at himself in the mirror, wearing his black T-shirt... staring at the strange, yet familiar face he sees. He turns his head this way and that... touches places under his eyes and around his mouth where only yesterday there were small lines of age. He hesitates for a moment... finally runs a hand through the shock of hair on his head. He grins at the image.
 Beverly is showing Riker an Okudagram display of some medical information.
 What is left of the shuttlecraft is now a lot of junk sitting on the deck of the bay. O'Brien and a few N.D. ENGINEERS are re-assembling the components of the shuttle in some rough order -- like the positioning of debris after a plane crash. O'Brien examines a piece of debris with a tricorder... he then moves it into its proper place on the deck. Geordi ENTERS, carrying a PADD.
 As Geordi CRUSHES the metal into DUST with his bare hand.
 O'Brien reacts. Geordi peers at the dust in his hand.
 Young Ro is sitting quietly on the bed, lost in thought. Young Guinan is sitting on a chair, her legs dangling a bit in boredom. Young Guinan lets out a loud sigh. Young Ro ignores her.
 Geordi and O'Brien are talking to Riker and Beverly. Geordi gestures to a display of technical information.
 The Enterprise slows to orbital velocity around Ligos Seven, a planet shrouded in a gaseous atmosphere, wrapped in mystery.
 Riker, Worf, and Data at their stations.
 Two BIRDS OF PREY DECLOAK and immediately FIRE on the Enterprise.
 Young Picard is looking over the pottery shards under a 24th century microscope when the ship is HIT again. Young Picard instinctively jumps up and heads for the door as the ship goes to RED ALERT.
 As before. The ship's condition is RED.
 As before. The ship is ROCKED by another blast.
 PHASER FIRE hits a Klingon ship, but the ship is protected by its shields.
 As before.
 The Enterprise is struck by the torpedoes from both Klingon ships.
 As the Enterprise recoils from the impact...
 Geordi at the computer consoles...
 As before.
 Young Picard is running down a corridor toward a Turbolift. He arrives at the Turbolift and the doors OPEN -- but Young Picard pulls up short as an ARMED FERENGI comes out of the Turbolift and points the weapon at Young Picard. He's been caught.
 Geordi is in his office. He hears the SOUND of phaser FIRE and comes running out, but it's too late -- TWO FERENGI have him and his men covered by their weapons.
 As before.
 TWO FERENGI, BERIK and MORTA, MATERIALIZE on the Bridge with alien rifles drawn...
 Hits the deck and rolls out of the way of a phaser BLAST. He quickly hits his combadge.
 A FERENGI is guarding O'Brien, who is now a prisoner. As the doors open, FERENGI Guards herd more Adult Crew Members (among them, Geordi) into the room...
 Riker is standing off to one side, under guard. Worf and Data are still unconscious on the deck. Berik and Morta are trying to work one of the aft consoles, but are having no success.
 The Enterprise is re-entering orbit, with a Bird of Prey nearby.
 Young Ro, Young Guinan, Young Keiko, and SEVERAL N.D. CHILDREN are in the school room. The real kids are jabbering to each other with concern... there is an edge of fear in the air and it wouldn't take much more to turn this scene into hysteria.
 Daimon Lurin is making himself comfortable in Picard's chair, as Riker ENTERS. (We see a Ferengi guard just outside the door).
 Young Ro and Young Keiko are taking apart a small section of bulkhead at one end of the room.
 Young Picard and Young Guinan are at the desktop computer terminal seen earlier.
 She manages to pull the final Mees panel away from the bulkhead, revealing a Jeffries Tube behind the wall.
 As a TOY suddenly bumps up against Young Picard's leg. Alexander comes running up, carrying a remote control PADD and looking apologetic. The toy looks like a cross between a lunch-box and a spider, with several odd-looking armatures poking out from the sides. There are no apparent wheels, but it glides along the floor.
 The ship is in orbit.
 FERENGI #1 is standing behind the console. The doors OPEN and the toy seen earlier ENTERS the room. The Ferengi looks at it in puzzlement for a moment... then the toy EXITS again.
 The Ferengi ENTERS from the Transporter Room just in time to see the toy disappear around the corner. He follows it.
 Young Picard -- carrying the remote control seen earlier -- and Young Keiko ENTER. Young Keiko moves quickly to the storage lockers on the far side of the room while Young Picard moves to the Transporter Console and starts to rapidly enter information into the console. Young Keiko opens the locker and removes several PHASERS.
 From this angle, we can now see that there is a COMBADGE attached to it.
 The Ferengi continues his solitary watch.
 Young Ro and Young Guinan are moving quickly down the tube on their hands and knees.
 FERENGI #2 is on guard duty here... but he's pretty bored at this point and is sitting at Beverly's desk, toying with some of the items on the desk.
 As the Ferengi EXITS to the Corridor... Alexander ENTERS from the other door to Sickbay. He quickly moves to a storage bin and begins pulling out hyposprays. Once he has as many as he can carry, he runs back OUT of the room.
 Young Ro and Young Guinan come scrambling down the tube.
 Alexander comes scrambling out of the Jeffries Tube, with hyposprays. Young Picard and Young Keiko are there to meet them.
 Berik is still standing guard in the Corridor outside the school room. The doors OPEN and Young Picard ENTERS the corridor. Berik levels his phaser at him.
 Riker is staring outside, deep in thought. The door suddenly OPENS and Berik ENTERS, dragging the red-eyed Young Picard...
 Young Picard and "Dad" Riker sit together at the table while Berik keeps a watchful eye on them. As Young Picard stares up at Riker...
 Alexander and the other children wait with Young Keiko. Suddenly the doors open and Young Picard is shoved INTO the room by Berik.
 Lurin is peering at Picard's fish with interest... he gropes about with his hand, looking for a way to reach inside. The door CHIMES.
 Riker and Morta ENTER from the Ready Room. They go to one of the aft stations and sit down.
 As Riker distracts Morta with this nonsense, his right hand begins to quickly enter information into one of the keypads on the terminal.
 Young Picard is watching the terminal. Suddenly the image of the brightly colored ship's diagram on the terminal is replaced with the STANDARD STARFLEET LOGO. Young Picard reacts and then immediately begins to work the terminal as Young Keiko and Alexander look on.
 Ferengi #1 is still here, standing guard. He moves around the room in boredom...
 As it suddenly begins to MOVE around the room... it turns this way and that, suggesting that it is looking for something... finally it moves to Ferengi #1 and stops between his legs.
 Young Picard and Alexander watch the computer terminal. They exchange pleased looks.
 Berik is still standing guard outside the school room. The door OPENS and Alexander ENTERS. Berik is immediately wary.
 A FERENGI is guarding a corridor intersection. Suddenly, a hypospray reaches up from behind the Ferengi and is pressed against his neck.
 The Transporter platform is now filled with SEVERAL FERENGI (including Berik), who are very unhappy at their captivity. One of them BOUNCES off the FORCEFIELD.
 Young Picard is at the terminal. He looks satisfied. After a beat... picks up a phaser and heads for the door. Alexander is standing on guard in the open doorway, looking up and down the Corridor with a phaser in her hand.
 Riker is still droning on to Morta, who is hopelessly lost at this point.
 Lurin is sitting at the desk. The door CHIMES.
 The Enterprise in orbit around Ligos Seven.
 Beverly and O'Brien are at the console, while Young Picard, Young Guinan and Young Keiko watch.
 Young Ro sits at a child-sized desk, drawing with crayons. A sad, lonely portrait.
 orbiting a RED GIANT GASEOUS PLANET.
 PICARD is sitting in a chair, playing a quiet MELODY on his FLUTE (as seen in "The Inner Light"). Over the com system, two other instruments can be heard -- a CLARINET and a CELLO. Picard is playing along with the music form a pleasant harmony.
 Worf ENTERS the room, where ALEXANDER is waiting for him. Alexander rushes up to him, excited about something.
 A street right out of the OLD WEST. DIRT ROAD, WOODEN BUILDINGS, TOWNSFOLK, HORSES. There's a SALOON with a sign out front that reads "The Gold Strike Saloon"... and there's a SHERIFF'S OFFICE. The street is quiet on this day... not a lot of activity... just a few townsfolk mingling about... the wind curling up dust...
 sitting in a rocking chair on a porch, rocking slowly back and forth, making a continuous CREAKING sound. The man puffs on his pipe, hat pulled down over his eyes to block the sun...
 attached to a hitching post.
 rocking in his chair... creaking... Suddenly he STOPS rocking. Silence. The man tilts his head upward slightly to look at the road. Gradually, the SOUND of FOOTSTEPS can be heard... coming closer...
 A large pair of boots on large feet, taking large steps, spurs jangling, stirring up dust...
 stomps and whinnies nervously, as if in response...
 come to a stop. A second later, more FOOTSTEPS are heard and a second PAIR OF BOOTS comes into view -- a very small pair by comparison. Big boot, little boots.
 squinting into the sun to see who is there...
 wearing the boots, standing side by side -- lone figures on the Western street. They are both dressed in WESTERN ATTIRE, holsters and GUNS at their sides. They each wear an old-style BADGE on their chest. They are lawmen.
 in orbit around the red giant planet.
 Data, Geordi and VARIOUS N.D.s. Data is sitting by an opened console. A panel on his head is OPEN, revealing various circuitry within. Fiber-optic cables connect Data's circuits to the console circuits.
 attached to a wall in the room. The poster shows a drawing of a man's face and the words "WANTED: DEAD OR ALIVE." There is a fresh bullet hole in the forehead of the man. Two more GUNSHOTS ring out, and we see two more BULLET HOLES RIP through the drawing of the man's face...
 holding a smoking pistol, having just fired the shot. Clearly, this is the same man as in the poster. He is a young, cocky, dangerous gunslinger.
 A smoky barroom occupied by several PEOPLE. A PIANO PLAYER sits at the piano, picking out a jaunty tune. The barkeep, a pretty woman named ANNIE MEYERS, stands behind the bar, glaring at Eli.

 standing at the door, holding a Winchester RIFLE, having just fired the shot. The figure re-cocks the rifle, keeps it aimed. The figure wears a wide-brimmed hat that obscures his face. A beat goes by, then the stranger raises his head slightly...
 as he theatrically SPINS HIS PISTOL in the palm of his hand, then holsters it.
 in orbit.
 Data is still connected to the console -- his eyes are open and he is conscious. Geordi is working at a console; N.D.s work nearby. They've been at this awhile.
 As he theatrically SPINS THE TRICORDER in the palm of his hand, and replaces it in his belt holster, just like Eli Hollander did.
 Data has not noticed his strange movement. He goes about his work, as if nothing is wrong...
 The building has a sign out front that reads "SHERIFF'S OFFICE."
 Eli is in a small JAIL CELL off to one side -- he's sitting on the cot, shuffling a deck of CARDS on a small table. (NOTE: His card shuffling is unpracticed and clumsy.)
 as it bursts open and Annie Meyers ENTERS. She scans the room, spots Worf and, flushed with excitement, rushes to him. She grabs him by the collar and plants a huge kiss on his lips. Worf reacts, stunned.
 in orbit.
 Picard is holding a cup of tea. He sits down in his chair... takes a relaxing sip of the tea...
 Beverly is using the space to rehearse the play. RIKER and TWO CREWMEMBERS make up the cast. They are sitting in a semi-circle, listening to Beverly's direction. Everyone is holding a PADD.
 Geordi and Data are examining opened PADDs. Several other PADDs are sitting nearby. Beverly watches, curious. Geordi sets aside the PADD.
 CLOSE ON Alexander walking along, holding a small canvas BAG. He opens up the bag and peers inside, shakes the bag a little, causing it to JANGLE -- it's obviously full of money. He smiles and continues to jangle the bag...
 A short time later. The bandito and the henchmen are leading Alexander through the dark, abandoned tunnel. Alexander's hands are tied together with a rope, his mouth gagged by a bandanna.
 orbiting the red giant planet.
 Data is standing at a replicator slot.
 Troi and Worf are standing face to face, feet apart in a ready stance. She is showing Worf how to draw a. gun. Eli is in cell, clumsily shuffling his deck of cards.
 Various townsfolk are present; the piano player is playing a tune. Worf ENTERS the saloon, takes a look around the room, and crosses to the bar.

 Continuous. Worf and Troi staring at Data/Eli, surprised by the sight.
 in orbit around the red giant.
 Picard, Riker, Data, Geordi. Mid-conversation.
 Troi is pacing nervously, rifle in-hand. She glances out the window... moves back to the desk... waiting...
 sitting on the cot, SHUFFLING the deck of cards at HYPER SPEED -- android speed. He proceeds to deal a hand of solitaire at hyper-speed... then plays out the game at hyper-speed...
 standing face to face, separated by the cell door.
 Data/Frank moves to Worf and Troi, adamant.
 orbiting the red giant.
 Data is sitting by a console, a panel in his head open, being examined by Geordi. Riker ENTERS and crosses to them. Data has gotten worse -- he slips in and out of a Texan accent throughout the scene, completely unaware of his bizarre behavior.
 A hand-drawn map of the center of town, laid out on the Sheriff's desk. Worf has made the map himself. He is pointing to one end of town with a stylus -- an inkwell is close at hand.
 Worf and Troi are looking at the map, speaking softly, so Data/Eli cannot hear. On the desktop, we can see Worf and Troi's communicators laid out. They are having a makeshift tactical conference. There is a sense of urgency in the air as they plan a strategy.
 It reads four o'clock...
 It now reads five fifteen.
 Worf is making some last-minute adjustments to a DEVICE attached to his holster -- it's a small metallic box, fashioned from spare parts. Copper wiring connects the device to a communicator pin on Worf's vest.
 WIDE ANGLE on the same street seen earlier. But it is now empty, except for a couple of TOWNSPEOPLE who are hurrying on their way. A sense of foreboding is in the air...
 Data/Frank steps into view, holding Alexander by the arm. He stops, waiting. Somewhere, A CHURCH BELL starts to TOLL... six times total throughout the scene...
 walking to his spot at the opposite end of the street. He still wears the make-shift device on his holster, and the communicator pin on his chest. Data/Eli is at his side.

 Alexander!
 OPENS FIRE on Worf with android proficiency --
 As he is hit by the first TWO BULLETS, a FORCE FIELD activates around his body, deflecting the bullets in crazy ricochets. (NOTE: The force field should look unstable and staticky.) Worf stumbles backward from the impact of the hits... tries to keep his balance...
 crawls out from behind the rain barrel and into the safety of the saloon... stops just inside the door and peers out so he can watch the gunfight...
 gets to his feet and out of the line of fire...
 relentlessly takes aim again...
 takes the impact of TWO MORE BULLETS, the FORCE FIELD FLASHING AND FRITZING with every strike... looking more unstable with every hit. Another BULLET hits... then another BULLET and the FORCE FIELD FRITZES OUT COMPLETELY. Worf reacts, realizing he's vulnerable -- hits the switch on the device but it won't work...
 takes aim and pulls the trigger -- but the gun has run out of bullets. His six-shooter CLICKS empty... click, click, click...

 Worf thinks it over... keeps his pistol trained...
 The room is empty, except for Alexander, who is standing by the door, peering outside. Worf and Troi ENTER.
 ENTERING the saloon -- she now LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE DATA.
 in orbit, facing another SHIP -- the Biko.
 Alexander is lying in his bed, exhausted from his adventure, fast asleep. Worf stops at the bed to check in on him. Satisfied, he turns to go. Alexander opens his eyes and looks at Worf.
 As the ship LEAVES ORBIT of the planet, a distant ORANGE STAR comes into view. The Enterprise flies off in the direction of the star, BACKLIT by the ORANGE GLOW... like a sunset...
 The ship is in orbit around the fiery, red moon of a planet. A small SPACE STATION also orbits the moon, and a glowing blue PILLAR OF ENERGY extends from the station down to the surface of the moon.
 The station core is unfinished, with equipment consoles scattered about. In several places, the walls are cut through with holes which lead away to access tunnels deep within the station. A Transporter pad and console are in one corner. In the center of the floor is a large, glowing circular core (similar to the Enterprise's warp core).
 DATA sits at the Aft Science station, studying the monitor with concern. WORF is at Tactical.
 Lots of ND activity in the b.g. as Geordi and Farallon work a pair of consoles.
 It's a box-like device with a CONTROL PANEL with flashing indicators and various sensor attachments -- this is an EXOCOMP. (Note: the exocomp should be small enough to be carried easily by one person.)
 She takes a CONTROL PADD out of the locker. She moves quickly to an access tunnel hole and places the exocomp in front of it.
 If it doesn't work, we'll still have time to shut down the fountain...
 Data studies his console.
 Farallon and Geordi stand at the access tunnel, waiting.
 Commander La Forge, please report.
 As before, in orbit near the space station.
 Data is waiting in front of the platform. TRANSPORTER CHIEF KELSO is at the console.
 The exocomp is on the pool table. It has been opened up, and inside is a complex mass of circuitry and components.
 Data, Geordi, and Farallon.
 With a replicator-life effect, a tech tool MATERIALIZES on the exocomp.
 Geordi studies the new tool and smiles.
 Farallon is there with Picard, Data, and Geordi.
 Data watches carefully as an exocomp works on a darkened console. A panel is open, and a robot-like arm sprouting from the exocomp is working inside. Suddenly, the darkened console LIGHTS UP and hums to life.
 It ENTERS THE TUNNEL.
 Well, Mister Data. What is your analysis so far?
 in orbit near the space station.
 Geordi with Data and Farallon, examining the unresponsive exocomp. Geordi's in the process of connecting an optical cable from the exocomp to a computer console.
 Data is at his desk with the exocomp and its control padd nearby. Several TECH tools are lying about. Data links the exocomp to the ship's computer with an optical cable.
 Geordi ENTERS, spots Farallon sitting alone at a table, gazing out the windows. He approaches.
 BEVERLY and WORF are dressed in loose workout uniforms. Beverly is sitting on a sickbed; there is a bruise on her forearm. An ND NURSE administers to her with a TECH device. WORF stands near the bed, lecturing Beverly patiently. Beverly seems more excited than hurt.
 Geordi approaches Farallon.

 Picard, Data, Troi, Beverly, Geordi, and Farallon. Farallon is fuming.
 Farallon, Data, Geordi, and Picard are gathered near the Jeffries tube. Farallon is standing near the exocomp with the control PADD in her hands. Geordi works a console briefly and looks up.

 Data is at the console with the exocomp's control PADD nearby. Sporadic flashes coming from the Jeffries tube indicate that there's something going on inside it.
 Farallon is at a console, talking to Geordi and Picard.
 Riker and Worf at their stations. The concern on their face is evident... they know the situation.
 Picard herds two NDs onto the Transporter pad. Geordi is already at the Transporter console. Secondary explosions continue to go off in the b.g. Picard is not on the pad.
 The five people from the station are walking off the platform, having just beamed in.
 Data ENTERS from the Turbolift and takes his position.
 Geordi and Picard are lit by the flickering glow of the core. They have moved a few consoles into an area of the station farthest from the core. There's a feeling of urgency as Picard moves a final console into place.
 Data and Riker are at the Aft science station.
 Farallon is now on the Bridge. The air is tense and grim. Riker and Data move to the command chairs.
 Farallon and Kelso. The three exocomps are on the Transporter platform. Farallon is tapping the last few commands into the control PADD. She finishes and moves a com panel.
 Mister Worf, target two hundred meters below the apex of the particle stream and feed the coordinates to Transporter Room Two.

 Data, Riker, and Farallon. She is working the control PADD. The three exocomps are on the Transporter pad.
 The exocomps MATERIALIZE near the damaged core. Picard, working on his console, sees them arrive.
 Commander, I've got a pattern lock!
 Two of the exocomps begin to DEMATERIALIZE... one of them remains intact, projecting the energy beam... making it possible for the other two to transport. Then they are gone... it is left alone... the energy beam DISAPPEARS. The exocomp BEEPS once... and then its lights blink out one by one.
 The two exocomps are in place on the platform. Kelso is working at the console.

 PICARD is just removing a cup of tea from the replicator. The door CHIMES.
 Riker, DATA, and TROI are seated around the table, listening to Admiral Nechayev as she paces about the room. Nechayev's attitude is clipped and to the point... she has no time for niceties here. Riker and the others are a little off-balance as they play catch-up in this rapidly changing situation.
 BEVERLY and WORF are running down a dark tunnel. They are each wearing black jumpsuits, with backpacks and they're both smudged and dirty. They round a corner and stop. Worf looks back down the tunnel while Beverly quickly pulls a DEVICE out of her pack and sets it on the ground. Worf FIRES a blast down the tunnel into the darkness as Beverly activates the unit and a FORCEFIELD FLASHES into effect, covering the width of the tunnel.
 They both glance down the tunnel and then turn to go... but they quickly stop as they run into CARDASSIAN #1, who is pointing a weapon at them both.

 Riker is waiting near the platform. After a beat, CAPTAIN EDWARD JELLICO MATERIALIZES. He is a lean, trim man with rugged features and flashing eyes. He bounds off the platform and moves quickly to Riker, his every move suggesting a boundless supply of energy and enthusiasm.
 Jellico and Riker ENTER from the Transporter Room. Jellico sets a brisk pace.
 The Cairo peels off from the Enterprise and heads away. (STOCK)
 A large number of N.D. CREWMEMBERS are gathered here along with Data, Riker, GEORDI, Troi, Worf, and Beverly (now back in normal uniform).

 Beverly sits down on one of the benches against the wall. She stretches a couple of sore muscles. Troi joins her.

 The ship at warp.
 Jellico is standing at the Tactical station with Riker and Data. There is one N.D. CREWMEMBER at an aft station and another CREWMEMBER standing by to take over Tactical.
 Jellico and Geordi are in the tube. Jellico is opening a Mees panel and looking inside.
 Jellico ENTERS by climbing up through the Jeffries Tube, with Geordi close behind. Jellico, as usual, is moving quickly and efficiently while Geordi struggles to make notes on his PADD and answer Jellico's questions. Data is also here.
 The ship at warp.
 Jellico is standing near the door, holding Picard's book of Shakespeare and looking through the pages. An intricate wood carving is sitting on the pedestal where the book normally sits. In the b.g., the fish tank is gone as well as the model of the Stargazer.
 Riker and Geordi are on the move. Geordi's pretty irritated.
 Picard ENTERS. He is wearing the black jumpsuit and backpack, but now he's splattered with mud, and he looks totally exhausted. He wearily takes off the backpack and collapses into a chair with an audible sigh of relief. He closes his eyes for beat, and then the door CHIMES. Picard manages to sit up.
 The ship drops out of warp.
 Jellico and Picard are seated at the desk looking over some PADDS. Picard is back in his normal uniform and seems much fresher.
 The shuttle moves away from the Enterprise. (STOCK)
 Picard, Beverly, and Worf are seated in the shuttle. Worf is piloting. Behind them can be seen packs.
 The ship goes into warp. (STOCK)
 As before. Picard turns to the others.
 A small hole-in-the-wall bar (similar to the bar seen in "Unification II"). There are a few N.D. ALIENS hanging out doing deals or drinking themselves into oblivion. Picard, Beverly, and Worf ENTER and look around. They are all wearing civilian jackets over their jumpsuits.
 The two ships are facing each other in space. (STOCK)
 Jellico, Troi, and Data are at their stations. (Troi is now in a standard blue uniform.) Riker ENTERS from the Observation Lounge.
 Jellico is sitting at his desk. (In the b.g., the crayon drawings seen earlier are now framed and are hanging on the walls.) The door CHIMES.
 A barren, rocky planet.
 The cavern is dark and moody, with dimly-seen forms and shadows. There are also intermittent SOUNDS which suggest there are living creatures scuttling about somewhere in the gloom.
 They round a corner and come to a stop. The floor drops off directly in front of them. Picard moves cautiously to the edge and looks over.
 A yawning chasm opens up below the precipice. There are distant walls and shapes dimly seen down the abyss, but the bottom is far out of sight.
 Picard leans back as Beverly points her tricorder over the edge.
 Removes a piton from the pack and places it against the ground. He touches a control and then there is a WHOOSH SOUND.
 As they put on their harnesses, Beverly can't help glancing nervously over the edge. Worf notices.
 As the three of them begin rapelling down the deep cavern...
 The two ships sitting in space. (STOCK)
 GUL LEMEC is sitting at the table, quietly furious. After a few beats, Jellico, Riker, and Troi ENTER. Lemec stands up in anger, but Jellico strides into the room and begins to take charge of the situation.
 Jellico, Riker and Troi emerge from the Observation Lounge. Data is at Ops.
 Picard and Worf are standing at the bottom of the abyss. It's a flat area, branching out into more tunnels. Beverly is still on the rope, taking the last few steps down the rock face. She jumps to the bottom and Worf helps her unhook the line from her harness. Picard scans the area with a tricorder.
 Picard, Worf, and Beverly come around a corner into another section of the caverns where there is a dead end. There is a SMALL HOLE, about one foot in diameter in the wall which is directly in front of them. Picard tracks his tricorder readings to the hole.
 As he pulls out his phaser and adjusts the setting. He points it at the entrance and then FIRES. The phaser is set on a WIDE BEAM which envelops the entire entrance. When Worf stops firing, it is revealed that the phaser has WIDENED the entrance to the lava tube by about two feet. We can now see more of the tube, which is just large enough for a person to crawl along on their hands and knees. The tube is smooth on the inside.
 The two ships hang in space.
 Gul Lemec is sitting in his chair, flanked by GLIN CORAK and GLIN TAJOR, his aides. Jellico, Riker, and Troi ENTER. The Cardassians stand. Jellico acts as though the previous confrontation with Lemec never happened.

 waits anxiously at the entrance to the tube. A few beats pass.
 Picard, Beverly and Worf come around a corner and see a METAL HATCH set into the wall. There is no other sign of an installation here except for the bare metal door. They wait behind some rocks for a moment.
 They all rush inside and find... nothing. There is no Cardassian installation... just a large empty chamber in the caverns. The only thing in sight is a small CONSOLE sitting in the middle of the chamber which is quietly BEEPING.

 Picard puts his hands on his head as an armed Cardassian takes his pack and combadge from him as well as his weapon.

 Riker is looking at a monitor at the aft science station as Jellico ENTERS from the Ready Room.
 Jellico moves to his desk and activates the terminal. After a moment, the Starfleet logo is replaced by the image of Admiral Nechayev.
 The room is very large with a huge entry door. (Footsteps tend to echo in here.) There are few furnishings except for the center of the room where there is a large DESK. Although not immediately apparent, the desk has many hidden panels and drawers. Next to the desk is the INTERVIEW CHAIR, an ominous looking piece of furniture with the ability to manacle the subject's wrists and ankles.
 Picard is in a chair. A Cardassian MED TECH checks a PADD which increases or decreases the amount of neural chemicals administered. Gul Madred sits behind his desk, checks his PADD during Picard's responses.
 The two ships facing each other in space.
 JELLICO, RIKER, and TROI are seated at the table, wearily listening to GUL LEMEC, who is pacing the room and droning on and on. GLIN CORAK and GLIN TAJOR are also seated.
 A door at the far end of the chamber opens.
 Picard is still in the same position. His head slumps onto his chest occasionally as he cannot fight sleep. Behind him, the door opens.
 as they ENTER the room. Madred is carrying the Cardassian equivalent of a thermos bottle; the guards, a robe. As the guards remove Picard from the bar on the ceiling and put the robe on him, Madred opens the thermos, pouring himself hot tea.
 Picard watches Madred as he drinks the tea... his own mouth is dry and parched. He hasn't had water for a long time. Madred is conscious of his need.
 There are four separate lights in the fixture.
 Picard turns back to Madred. He's not sure where this is going, but he is still alert for any opportunity to resist -- and, if possible, land a psychological blow on his opponent.
 as Madred's fingers enter commands. There is a cry of pain from Picard.
 The Enterprise, which is still hanging in space with the Reklar.
 WORF is on a biobed, having his shoulder wound tended by an N.D. NURSE. BEVERLY is on another bed, being checked over by another NURSE. Jellico and Riker are listening to Beverly, who is exhausted and depressed.
 Jellico and Riker ENTER from Sickbay and head toward a Turbolift.
 The two ships hang in space.
 Jellico, Riker, and Troi are seated at the table. Gul Lemec, Glin Tajor, and Glin Corak are also seated. Lemec is holding a Cardassian PADD. He activates the PADD and then SLIDES it across the table toward Jellico.
 It shows Picard, a prisoner, seated in the Interview chair. This is a recording of Picard as seen in the Teaser, when he was under the influence of the truth inducer.
 Jellico turns off the PADD and looks up at Lemec. Riker and Troi are troubled by this vision of their former captain.
 Jellico is speaking to someone o.c. His attitude is warm and friendly.
 Gul Madred and his daughter, JIL ORRA, an angelic young girl of seven, are at the desk, working with a small twenty-fourth century cage. The cage contains a Cardassian PET. Picard is unconscious on the floor, and now wears a robe.

 Jellico is speaking with Gul Lemec on the Viewscreen. Data is seated in the First Officer's chair and Worf is at Tactical. Geordi is working at one of the aft stations.
 The ship goes into warp.
 Picard is lying on the ground again... semi-conscious. His lips are parched and cracked... he is singing softly in his hoarse voice.
 As Picard walks past him for the door. When Picard is a few steps away from leaving the room Gul Madred looks up from his PADD. He does not look at Picard.
 He freezes in his tracks. He considers going on, but instead turns back to Gul Madred.
 The ship at warp.
 Jellico, Data, Beverly, Troi, Geordi and Worf.
 Picard is on the floor, unconscious. Off-screen, we HEAR a tap-tap-tap that is unidentified. Picard begins to stir, as though hearing the tapping. His eyes flicker open as he swims out of unconsciousness and back into the nightmare. He looks toward Gul Madred... and sees him carefully breaking the shell of a boiled egg, tapping gently, peeling away the membrane. He looks down and sees Picard staring at him.
 Instead of a boiled egg, it is raw and alive,... full of a pulsating, gelatinous blob.
 Picard stares at it, revolted... Madred watches closely, a smile on his lips... then Picard tips the egg into his mouth and takes the entire mass into his mouth. He chews and swallows -- and Madred bursts into delighted laughter.

 Worf and an N.D. SECURITY OFFICER are standing by several CONTAINERS, which are about the size of a suitcase. They are checking them over with tricorders. Jellico ENTERS and goes to Worf. The large shuttlecraft is in the b.g.
 Geordi is working as Jellico ENTERS.

 Riker is sitting at his desk, looking over the book of Shakespeare that Picard once had in the Ready Room. He flips through the pages for a moment.
 The door CHIMES and Riker closes the book.
 The shuttle leaves the Enterprise.
 Jellico, Data, Troi, and Worf at their stations.
 Riker and Geordi are at the controls. The view out the window is obscured by the billowing CLOUDS from the nebula. Behind them can be seen the MINES seen earlier in the shuttlebay. The ship SHAKES SLIGHTLY. As they report the loss of systems, their attitude is calm -- they were expecting this.
 The monitor shows a graphic display of the area in front of the ship. The screen is fuzzy and ill-defined. It's a very primitive display, similar to that of early WWII radar sets.
 The proximity detector is working... we should pick up their ships at a distance of... five hundred meters.
 The monitor screen shows nothing... then suddenly a LARGE SHAPE appears on the screen very close to the position of the shuttle.
 Riker reacts to the screen.

 Worf and an N.D. are working near the damaged section of floor. Worf is using a PHASER to cut out the section of deckplate which has been melted.
 Riker and Beverly are standing at the scene of the struggle. Geordi is working at a console in the background.
 Worf finishes cutting with the phaser. He and the N.D. pick up the melted section of deckplate and set it aside.
 nods and moves to Geordi. The dog is sitting at Geordi's feet.
 Geordi ENTERS with the dog. The room is decorated with exotic artwork... various personal items can be seen... the bed is unmade. The place is cramped, but it has a comfortable, "lived in" look. There is a desk with a workstation. Geordi sits down and activates the MONITOR -- it shows STATIC.
 The section of deckplate is sitting on a table in the center of the room. The DONUT has been placed over the deckplate. From beneath the donut can be seen SMALL BEAMS which are SCANNING the leading edge of the metal. Thin WISPS of SMOKE are coming up from where the beams touch it.
 As seen before.
 Geordi is still at the wall panel, working to access more logs. The dog is lying on the floor, asleep. Geordi makes a final adjustment to the panel, then glances at the monitor screen -- still STATIC.
 The static is gone -- in its place the freeze-framed image of AQUIEL UHNARI. She is an alien woman, dressed in a Starfleet uniform. She has an exotic look: her head is totally bald... she has piercing green eyes, similar to a cat's. She's alien... striking... beautiful...
 as he reacts to the sight...
 A few minutes later. Geordi is at the desk, fiddling with the computer module, the image of Aquiel is still on the monitor. After a beat, the image COMES TO LIFE and she begins to speak. She is in her quarters.
 Geordi is reporting to Picard.
 The dog is lying on the floor. Geordi is at his console, connecting the computer module (as seen on the station) to the desk terminal. He makes a final adjustment.
 The two hanging in space.
 Worf is kneeling down in the corner of the station where the murder occurred. He scans with a tricorder as Riker looks on.
 Geordi is sitting at the desk, reading the book seen earlier on the nightstand -- "The Fatal Revenge." A DEVICE with an optical conduit is hooked up to the computer terminal... the device is flashing and beeping softly. Geordi turns a page in the book... he reacts to something and shudders slightly.
 Picard, Riker, Beverly and Geordi are seated at the table.
 A few moments later. Everyone has taken a seat at the table. Aquiel is talking to the group -- trying to make a report, but the past couple of days have been a strain on her. A nasty-looking WOUND can be seen on her temple. Her uniform is torn. She is fatigued, on edge.
 as she comes bounding across the room into Aquiel's arms, nearly knocking her over in her enthusiasm. Aquiel is surprised and pleased to see her.
 Geordi and Aquiel are sitting at a table near the windows. Aquiel looks around the room, which is filled with N.D. CREWMEMBERS. She's starting to relax a little... and her natural charm and allure is starting to surface. Geordi is clearly attracted to her -- but he tries to maintain a cordial distance.
 Riker is reporting to Picard. They are looking at a desktop monitor, which displays the personnel file of LIEUTENANT KEITH ROCHA. His image can be seen on the screen -- a fit man in his late thirties.
 Hanging in space.
 Geordi and Aquiel walking along. There is a strained silence before they speak, and we get the feeling it's been like that.
 Beverly is examining a tray filled with the gelatinous FLUID which has finally been separated from the deckplate. She runs a tricorder over the fluid and checks the readings. The medical N.D. stands nearby, working. Picard is looking on.
 Aquiel's SHUTTLECRAFT is in the bay, its doors open.
 Riker and Worf are inside, searching for clues. Riker is looking in the back. Worf is at the main control panel, scanning the area. After a moment, he opens a compartment on the console... looks inside... reacts to what he finds...
 holding position at the relay station.
 Aquiel is being questioned by Riker and Worf, as Geordi looks on. Riker's attitude is reasonable but firm.
 Riker, Worf and Geordi ENTERS from quarters. Geordi heads one direction, while Worf heads another. Riker stops Geordi.
 As seen before.
 Geordi is working at an opened panel near a MONITOR, trying to access Rocha's logs. He's been at it awhile. He completes an adjustment, and the monitor COMES TO LIFE with a Starfleet logo. Geordi is pleased.
 As seen before.
 Geordi and Aquiel are standing near the console where Geordi was working. The monitor displays the logs with the missing entries. The mood is tense. Midconversation.
 Aquiel ENTERS and grabs a small suitcase and quickly starts to throw some clothing into it. Geordi ENTERS and watches her for a beat.
 Beverly is examining the tray filled with the dark, gelatinous fluid. She is holding a hand-held scanning INSTRUMENT over the tray. The medical N.D. stands nearby.
 The organic fluid suddenly COMES TO LIFE -- it MOVES toward Beverly's hand and TOUCHES her.

 A couple of hours have passed. Geordi is sitting on the edge of the bed. Aquiel is lying next to him, her eyes closed... face peaceful. Geordi looks at her a moment... then he stands and crosses to a nearby desk. Aquiel opens her eyes.
 Picard, Riker and Worf are listening to Beverly. The replica of BEVERLY'S HAND is still sitting in the tray.
 Geordi and Aquiel are holding the prism, which is now ALIVE WITH LIGHT -- RADIATING VIBRANT COLORS onto their faces. Aquiel opens her eyes and looks at Geordi.
 The Klingon Commander Morag is pacing the floor in his quarters, obviously pent-up and frustrated at being confined. Suddenly the doors slide open and Worf and a Security N.D. ENTER, phasers pointed.
 Aquiel sets the prism (no longer glowing) back onto the table. She takes Geordi's face into her hands... rests her cheek against his...
 Aquiel and Geordi react to the SOUND of someone materializing in the other room --
 as they ENTER the room. Geordi quickly puts on his VISOR as Riker points his phaser at Aquiel.

 Geordi and Aquiel are sitting at one of the tables. Aquiel is trying to make sense of everything that has happened.
 It's dark and we can see little of her face. Her eyes are closed tightly and she twitches restlessly, as though she's trying to pull away from something. It looks like she's having a nightmare.
 Deanna sits up on a bed, breathing heavily (note: we should see Deanna in dim silhouette only; the details of the room should be vague and shadowed as well). Her voice is cracked and dry.
 at warp.
 Deanna has not yet recovered from the shock of her transformation. She is groggy and disoriented. She's dressed in the uniform of a Romulan officer, but it's somewhat different from the ones we've seen in the past. The color is brighter and there is a distinctive insignia on her right shoulder.
 as it enters orbit around a planet.
 Several N.D. ROMULANS attend various stations around the perimeter. A single PILOT sits at a console in front of the main Viewscreen. The Commander's station is against the back wall. It is not a chair, but a raised platform upon which the Commander stands. It's encircled by a railing to lean on and several command consoles. The entire room is forward of the Commander. Every inch of the Bridge is under her surveillance at all times -- and nothing goes on behind her back.

 RIKER, BEVERLY, and WORF on the move. Beverly carries a medical tricorder; Riker and Worf do not look pleased at all.
 Continuous action as Riker, Beverly, nd Worf ENTER. An N.D. CREWMAN is at the console.
 DeSeve is looking around his quarters with uncertainty... he feels disoriented and alone here. He moves to the replicator.

 N'Vek is in a room with several large cargo containers stacked against the wall. An N.D. Romulan Centurion stands at attention nearby.

 Troi reacts, touching his face.
 This is a Conference/Officer's Room which is connected by a set of doors to the Bridge. Toreth, N'Vek, and two N.D. ROMULAN OFFICERS are seated at a table. A large meal is spread out before them. The Commander and her officers are friends, and the atmosphere is relaxed.
 Continuous action as Toreth and the others ENTER and take their stations. Troi stands near Toreth.
 As the captain speaks, Troi's features change; something is troubling her about this man. Something is wrong here. She quietly moves to N'Vek.
 Opens fire on the freighter, destroying it with a single shot.
 The Bridge crew is shocked. Toreth is furious and moves to N'Vek, grabbing him.
 Continuous action. Troi is still in shock over the ship's destruction and N'Vek's accusation. Toreth is furious.

 Cloak is engaged.

 Picard, Riker, Data, Worf and ENSIGN McKNIGHT at their stations.
 Picard is sitting at his desk as Worf ENTERS with DeSeve. Worf does not like this guy and stays as physically intimidating as possible.
 Data and Riker already there. Worf heads for his station.
 Troi paces, agitated. The guard is not there. N'Vek ENTERS. He's distressed, too, though not quite for the same reason.
 Troi and N'Vek with Toreth.
 Continuous action as Troi and N'Vek ENTER. Toreth is already at her station.
 The image fills the screen. It is the Enterprise, floating above us like a naval destroyer poised above a submarine, ready for the kill.
 Continuous action. The Enterprise is on screen as before.

 Picard, Riker, DeSeve and Data are at the Aft Science station, looking at a MONITOR DISPLAY of space debris.
 Troi and N'Vek.

 Picard, Riker, Data, and Worf at their stations. Ensign McKnight is at conn; DeSeve is in the b.g. (The ship is still at red alert.)
 Troi is on the Bridge. Toreth, Pilot, and N.D. Romulans at their stations.
 Where is it now, Mister Data... ?
 The atmosphere is tense. Toreth stands impassively on her platform, staring at the Viewscreen. Suddenly, she breaks the silence.
 The image of the Enterprise begins to grow as the warbird moves slowly closer.
 FADE IN: Picard, Riker, Worf at their stations; Data at Ops, McKnight at conn. The ship is still at red alert.
 Sir, the magnetic distortion has reappeared.
 Toreth stands at her command station. Troi, N'vek, Pilot, and N.D.s in their positions.
 The Warbird shimmers into view as it DECLOAKS in front of the Enterprise.
 Captain, we are being hailed.
 Troi APPEARS on the Viewscreen. Picard stares at her, shocked as he recognizes her, but canny enough not to reveal it.
 Troi turns to N'vek.
 as disruptor fire shoots from the Warbird toward the Enterprise. (NOTE: It should be of different intensity than normal disruptor fire.) There is no apparent damage.

 A similar scene of confusion.

 as Troi MATERIALIZES on the Transporter Pad. GEORDI is there, waiting for her.
 Ensign, get us out of here -- warp nine.
 at warp.
 Troi sits on a sickbed as Beverly scans her with a tricorder. Troi's Romulan features have been removed, but she is still in the Tal Shiar uniform. Picard stands at the bedside. The three Romulans are in the b.g., out of stasis.
 The room is in a state of frenetic activity. N.D. NURSES and DOCTORS are rushing about, grabbing equipment and moving consoles in preparation for some imminent emergency. BEVERLY grabs her medical tricorder as she directs people to action.
 We are now looking DOWN at the scene in Sickbay from directly overhead... as we begin to PUSH DOWN onto Picard's face, Beverly and the others can be seen working frantically on him, but there is NO SOUND except for a slowly building RUSHING NOISE, similar to the sound of the ocean. As Picard's face fills the frame, the rushing sound builds to a ROAR and suddenly the scene...
 SILENCE. Picard is standing in blindingly WHITE LIMBO without walls or ceiling. He is dazed and confused... unsure where he is or what's happening to him. He struggles to look around, but he cannot discern anything in this uniformly bright place. Suddenly an even more INTENSE LIGHT fills part of the scene. Picard holds up a hand to shield his eyes from this painfully intense light, but he does not retreat. He struggles to look into the light.
 The glowing luminescence has a form... it is the shape of a FIGURE standing in the light.
 determined to find out who this is, moves toward the silhouetted figure. He finally stops in front of it. He can barely look into the light at all.
 reaches out for him with one hand.
 reaches out toward the hand... they clasp hands and suddenly...
 revealing Q standing with Picard, holding his hand. Q is wearing white flowing ethereal robes.
 Picard angrily drops Q's hand.
 Picard slowly turns around and sees his father, MAURICE PICARD standing behind him. Maurice is in his eighties, but seems healthy and vital.
 The words knife through Picard. He turns back around... but Maurice is GONE. Picard stares out into the white emptiness for a moment.
 In the direction Q is looking, there are now three people standing in the dark: NAUSICAAN #1, #2, #3, and a YOUNG PICARD. The Nausicaans are large, burly aliens with hideous features. The Young Picard is about twenty-one years old and is wearing an old-style Starfleet uniform.
 Who have just seen the above action play out.
 He looks thoughtful as he recalls the events of his youth.
 Picard is wearing an old-style Ensign's uniform and he is standing in a standard set of quarters on a Starbase. An angry WOMAN is standing in front of him. OFF Picard's shocked expression.
 Picard is still shocked. The angry Woman turns on her heel and EXITS in a huff. Suddenly there is APPLAUSE and LAUGHTER from o.c. Picard turns to see...
 who are standing in the room. COREY ZWELLER is a tall, lanky, twenty-one year old, with long hair that probably barely passes regulations. MARTA BATANIDES is a short, pretty woman, and is also roughly twenty-one. They are both wearing old-style Starfleet Ensign uniforms and the jackets are unbuttoned, suggesting a casual gathering.
 The bar is a dilapidated, run-down, hole in the wall with mismatched furnishings, dirty walls, and indifferent service. The clientele consists mostly of passed-out bodies and disreputable figures conducting illegal deals in the shadows.
 Picard turns and discovers Q standing behind the bar dressed as a Bartender. Picard takes the towel in irritation and dries his face.
 If the Bar was decrepit, the Gambling Center is disgusting with even more decay and filth. There are various gaming devices and tables scattered around the room, but the center is dominated by a large DOM-JOT TABLE. Dom-Jot is a cross between billiards and craps. People place bets on various multi-colored images on the table as players take turns hit balls with cue sticks. There are many bumpers and pockets and lights come on according to the state of play.
 Revealing that Nausicaan #1 has just entered the Gaming area. The three officers turn to look at him.
 Continuous action from Act Two. Corey sizes up the Nausicaan... thinks he sees an easy mark.
 As Q (still dressed as the Bartender) ENTERS and moves to stand with Picard. The game between Corey and the Nausicaan begins in the b.g. as Q and Picard talk.
 Corey, Marta and Picard are gathered here. Corey is very upset.
 The Gambling Center is closed for the evening and the lights are off. Corey is underneath the Dam-Jot table, working with a couple of tools when Picard quietly ENTERS. Picard looks around quickly, but they're clearly alone. He moves silently over to the table.
 A redress of Picard's Quarters. Marta has taken her jacket off and is sitting on the edge of the bed, listening to Picard, who is upset about the prior scene.
 CLOSE ON Picard, who is sleeping in the bed alone. It's the next morning. A HAND reaches out and strokes his face gently... Picard smiles and slowly rolls over... he opens his eyes and finds Q lying on top of the covers next to him.
 It's still pretty early in the day for there to be many customers at the bar. Picard ENTERS and looks around for a beat before seeing Marta sitting at a far table with her back toward him. Picard smiles and moves to her. He puts a hand on her shoulder and gently kisses her head.
 Revealing Q standing near Picard.
 The Gambling Center is bustling with activity again. Picard, Corey, and Marta are sitting at a table in one of the corners. There is an awkward tension between the three of them and the drinks before them go largely untouched. A few beats of silence go by, then Picard tries to get the conversation going.
 which shows Nausicaans #1, #2, and #3 all ENTER the gambling center. Corey puts down his drink at the sight of the three burly aliens. Picard and Marta follow his gaze just as Nausicaan #1 sees Corey at the table. Corey tries to ignore the Nausicaans and forces himself to look down at his drink. But Nausicaan #1 moves over to the table and his two companions follow him.
 Picard is standing near the aft science station and Worf is standing next to him. Picard is wearing a blue uniform with the rank of Lieutenant and he is holding a PADD. DATA is sitting at the aft station. Worf impatiently repeats his question.
 Picard ENTERS the office. Someone is sitting in Beverly's chair, which is turned away from the doorway.
 GEORDI and an N.D. ENGINEER are working near the pool table as Picard (still in blue uniform) ENTERS, still carrying his PADD. Everything and everyone is exactly as it should be except for Picard. He looks around the familiar scene... unsure how to respond to all this.
 Picard ENTERS and looks around. After a beat, he sees Riker and TROI seated at a table near the window. He goes over to them.
 Picard ENTERS the Turbolift.
 The whiteness as seen before. Picard turns around and finds Q standing before him.
 Picard is standing between Corey and Nausicaan #1. He has been put back into the scene from Act Four during the confrontation.
 Manages to hold his own for a while... taking on one, then another of the giant warriors in turn. There is a sense in his actions and bearing that he is enjoying this fight... enjoying it as he did when it originally happened many years ago.
 As the serrated metal blade comes out of his chest. Picard drops to his knees and lets out a LAUGH of pure joy before falling to the ground...
 He is laughing, still on the operating table as seen in the Teaser.
 Revealing Beverly, Worf, and Riker looking on in puzzlement. Only a few minutes have passed since the events seen in the Teaser. Beverly is leaning over him with a medical DEVICE.
 The ship at impulse power.
 Picard is finishing a long talk with Riker.
 Picard and Riker are sitting in the Observation Lounge together. As Picard continues to tell Riker a tall tale from his youth, we PULL BACK and watch as the ship flies away into the star-filled void of space.
 docked at DEEP SPACE NINE.
 PICARD and BEVERLY come out of an AIRLOCK and begin walking down the street, past the storefronts and activity. Picard is carrying a briefcase; Beverly has a medical kit. Mid-conversation.
 WORF and GEORDI are moving away from the wall of replicators, having just made identical plates of FOOD. As they head for a table...
 A thin, creepy-looking ALIEN who is pointedly watching Worf from across the street. He slowly starts to make his way toward the Replimat. OFF his intent...
 DATA, RIKER, VARIOUS N.D.s at their positions. A small WARNING ALARM sounds on Data's console.
 JULIAN BASHIR is by himself, working on a TECH DEVICE -- a large, battered-looking cylinder. The device has been connected to a medical console with a small cable.
 Geordi and Worf are sitting at the table. Geordi's plate is still full and pushed away from him. Worf eats with enthusiasm.
 As before, Worf and Shrek. Worf is disbelieving.
 docked at DS9.
 Later. RIKER, TROI, N.D.s at their positions. Worf is standing at tactical, looking agitated. A SECURITY N.D. ENTERS from a Turbolift and crosses to Worf. He hands Worf a PADD and turns to go. Worf reads it.
 Later. Worf is dressed in his workout uniform, practicing his martial arts (as seen in "Man of the People"). His motions are slow and deliberate at first, as he tries to clear his mind... calming himself...
 Data, Bashir and Geordi are examining the battered cylinder seen earlier. Data indicates several input ports on the cylinder.
 as he falls to the floor. Geordi and Bashir can be heard talking, alarmed --
 Data is now lying on the floor in the corridor. He gets to his feet, glances around, startled at the change in setting. He begins walking down the corridor. The hall is empty and totally SILENT. There is an eerie and surreal quality to the scene, as in a dream. WE ARE EXPERIENCING DATA'S INTERNAL VISION.
 Data walking along. He sees something ahead of him... slows down at the sight...
 in full blacksmith attire, is sitting on a small bench in the middle of the corridor, a few feet away from Data. The man is pounding on a steel ANVIL with a HAMMER. His head is turned down, his face obscured.
 approaches the man... curious... He stops at the man, stares down at him...
 looks up at Data -- it is DOCTOR NOONIAN SOONG. He is a younger Soong than seen in "Brothers" -- a man in his late forties, hair graying slightly.
 reacts to the sight. Suddenly the scene...
 Data opens his eyes. He is still lying on the floor -- but a PANEL on the side of his head is now OPENED. Geordi is working on the circuitry within. Bashir stands nearby, watching anxiously. Data sits up and glances around the room.
 A few hours later. Data is running an internal self-diagnostic. A PANEL on his head is OPEN. Geordi is scanning Data's circuitry with a diagnostic INSTRUMENT. Bashir looks on, concerned.
 as before, docked at DS9.
 Worf is sitting alone by the windows, a drink on the table. His back is turned to everyone in the room -- clearly, he does not want to be bothered. He is lost in thought, reflecting on the day's events...
 as he ENTERS and scans the room -- sees Worf and heads for his table. He slows as he gets closer, not sure how to approach the inpenetrable-looking Worf.
 docked at DS9.
 Worf is walking past the storefronts, searching through the crowd. He glances upward -- sees Shrek on the upper level. He heads for the stairs with intent...
 where Shrek is standing, munching on a snack, his eyes sweeping the crowd as though on constant alert. Suddenly he senses something behind him, turns -- and sees Worf standing there, staring at him. He steps back, startled.
 at impulse.
 (Redress of Enterprise shuttle.) Shrek and Worf at the controls. Worf is dressed in DARK CAMOUFLAGE CLOTHING. They are studying a console MONITOR that shows a blurry, grainy GRAPHIC of a jungle and the surrounding terrain -- like a reconnaissance photo.
 docked at DS9.
 Picard is at his desk, studying a computer terminal. The door CHIMES.
 Decorated as usual; including a large POTTED PLANT visible in the corner. Data ENTERS and walks to his desk. He sits down and begins to contemplate the day's events. His CAT, Spot, hops up onto his lap. Data pets him a moment, absorbed in thought...
 A small, moonlit clearing in a dense tropical FOREST. From out of the foliage, Worf and Shrek appear. Worf is in his dark clothing, a BACKPACK strapped to his back. Shrek looks nervous. He takes a step forward, eyeing the area... then points the way...
 Worf is moving through the trees, covered with mud and brush -- he's been travelling for many hours, and it's beginning to show. He stops at a tree, leans against it to take a rest... takes off his backpack and pulls out a CONTAINER of water. He takes a long, thirsty drink. A quiet moment as he catches his breath...
 of Worf moving through the jungle, following the splashing sound. The noise grows louder as he gets closer... closer... until he stops and parts the trees... peers out and reacts to something he sees...
 of a POND in the jungle. Splashing around in the water is a young and beautiful KLINGON WOMAN -- BA'EL. She is nude, and oblivious to Worf's presence, enjoying her bath...
 steps back slightly and watches in silence... curious about the woman... surprised at the sight of her...
 rinses herself a few more times, luxuriating in the water. Then she begins to make her way toward the shore. As she emerges from the water...
 moves back into the jungle so he cannot be seen. Ba'el can be glimpsed in the background, partially obscured by trees, as she comes out of the water and slips into a loose-fitting robe...
 stops at the noise -- glances around, startled.
 isn't sure what to do. He watches as the Klingon woman makes her way toward him... closer...
 appears from within the jungle and walks up to Ba'el. The Romulan says something to her, but his words are not clear. Ba'el nods, grim-faced, and the two of them continue walking through the trees.
 docked at DS9.
 CLOSE ON A PAINT BRUSH sweeping across a canvas, quickly laying down bold strokes of color...
 as they open and Geordi ENTERS.
 There are at least TEN PAINTINGS of various shapes and sizes spread around the room, many on easels, others hanging where there is available space. Geordi ventures into the cramped area and gazes at the various paintings. Some of the paintings are complete; others are works in progress. All of the images are variations on a single theme: images derived from Data's "vision."
 who is standing between two canvases, a brush in each hand, working on two paintings at once. One painting shows a plume of smoke rising out of the bucket; the other is a rough sketch of what appears to be his father's face. Data wears an artist's smock, which is colorfully splattered with paint.
 A few hours later. Bashir is present, and is setting up the plasma coil cylinder seen earlier. He is connecting the optical cable from the cylinder to the dilithium chamber.
 as he falls back into the chair. Geordi and Bashir can be heard talking, but their voices grow distant... then fade away into total silence. Data's eyes are closed.
 He begins walking down the hall. It is empty and silent. There is an eerie and surreal quality to the scene, as in a dream.
 Data walking along. He sees something ahead of him... slows down at the sight...
 in full blacksmith attire, is sitting on a small bench in the middle of the corridor, a few feet away from Data. The man is pounding on a steel ANVIL with a HAMMER. His head is turned down, his face is obscured.
 approaches the man... curious... he knows this is the blacksmith from his original "vision." He stops at the man, stares down at him...
 looks up at Data -- it is Doctor Noonian Soong.
 reacts to the sight. He looks down at the anvil...
 as the hammer moves away to reveal what is not a piece of metal -- but a delicate BIRD'S WING.
 stares at Data a moment, then picks up the bird's wing with a pair of metal tongs... and dunks the wing into a BUCKET. SMOKE bursts up out of the bucket.
 Data is now standing on the Bridge. It is empty, except for the potted plant from his room, and a few of his recent paintings, which hang on various walls of the Bridge. His cat, Spot, is sleeping in the Captain's chair.
 is now on the Bridge. Data is lying on the bed, startled by the change in setting. Soong is standing beside the bed. The sound of birds SINGING can be heard.
 We are MOVING down the corridor in a floating POV -- as though through the eyes of a bird. Faster down the empty corridor... then we turn down another corridor and see Soong the blacksmith working at the anvil... and we SWOOP UPWARD into the light on the ceiling as the scene...
 A bird's eye view, MOVING past the Enterprise... and away from it... out into space... the stars whipping past... exciting... vast...
 CLOSE ON DATA'S FACE as he begins to regain consciousness. Geordi and Bashir are standing nearby.
 Data and Bashir walking along, mid-conversation. Data is clearly back to normal again -- conscious and safe.
 as seen from inside the compound. It's a tall security wall that surrounds the perimeter of the prison camp. A HAND clamps down from the outside of the wall and grabs hold of the edge... then a second hand appears. A moment later, Worf's head becomes visible as he hoists himself up and peers into the camp...
 of the large, dimly lit compound. A couple of small BARRACKS are visible... a MEETING HALL... and a small GARDEN area. The architecture is 24th Century, but it's clearly a little rough around the edges.
 suddenly round a corner. Worf immediately drops his head below the wall's edge to avoid being seen. He waits a tense moment before pulling himself up again. He glances around to make sure the coast is clear, then he pulls himself over the wall and DROPS to the ground inside the camp...
 inside the compound. He stays close to the wall a moment, silent and alert. Then he quickly runs to the shadows afforded by a barrack wall, and flattens himself against it. He looks around the corner toward the center of the compound...
 A half-dozen KLINGONS -- young and old -- dressed in the tunics are gathered around a large CAMP FIRE, listening to the gentle aria being sung by an elderly looking Klingon -- L'KOR.
 A large, sparsely appointed room. Various rectangular tables are located here and there, with accompanying chairs. The room is dimly-lit.
 L'KOR and the other Klingons have taken WORF back toward the center of the room; the Romulan Guards remain near the door.
 He is sitting alone on a BENCH to one side of the compound, surveying it. He looks around at the activity in the compound -- a young man is gardening; a group of young people run and play a game; three men play a game with dice.
 Worf ENTERS and takes out the TRANSPONDER Shrek gave him. It is FLASHING, indicating that Shrek's shuttle has returned.
 A Klingon woman puts an empty container in a storage barrel set against the compound wall.
 as Worf makes his way through it at a run. He reacts to the sound of the klaxon and hurries away.
 as the Romulan guards push through the same area of vegetation Worf just passed -- they are only moments behind him.
 as he glances back over his shoulder and changes direction.
 as they crane their heads to try and catch a glimpse of their quarry through the foliage.
 as he comes to the pond where he saw Ba'el and splashes his way through it, then up the other side and away.
 as they come to the pond. Some go around, some through.
 as he hides in some fronds. Two booted figures pass within feet of him as they search for him. When they're gone, he steals away in another direction.
 as they catch sight of him through a break in the foliage and resume their chase.
 as he comes to a clearing and sees a figure standing on the other side -- it is SHREK, the alien who brought him to the planet. Through the foliage, we catch a glimmer of his shuttle's hull.
 as he waves Worf to come toward him. Suddenly a look of concern crosses his features.
 as he reacts to the change of expression on Shrek's face -- too late. Suddenly he's tackled to the ground by a figure that lunges into the frame.
 as he takes a last look back at Worf and disappears into the foliage.
 on the ground, wrestling with whoever tackled him. He manages to throw the figure off him and is stunned to discover that it is Toq, the young Klingon who was tending the garden.
 as it hangs in space.
 PICARD ENTERS from his Ready Room. RIKER, DATA, TROI and various N.D's are at their posts.
 Establishing.
 Tokath ENTERS. L'Kor is with Worf, who is seated. The tension in the room is palpable. Toq and a Romulan guard stand off to the side, weapons in hand.
 as he comes around a corner into the space between two barracks. He smashes a fist against a barrack wall in frustration. Realizing he has to get hold of himself, he takes a deep breath and straightens his spine. He holds two fingers together and passes them down along the length of his torso -- this is the first movement of the Mok'bara, the Klingon martial art we saw him doing in Part One.
 as they begin to notice what the stranger is doing. Several teenaged Klingons watch Worf in fascination. Ba'el comes to see what they are looking at, as does Toq -- though everybody keeps their distance.
 as he decides Worf shouldn't be doing this and begins to cross toward him.
 as he corrects one of the young men.
 A redress of Worf's quarters, though these are cluttered with the trappings of a family's everyday life. Ba'el sticks her head in the door.
 Worf is recounting a Klingon myth around the campfire. His listeners are mostly young people, including Ba'el, their faces in rapt attention as he tells the story. An old Klingon woman sits nearby, listening and nodding. Toq sits further away, smirking to himself at the parts of the story he finds less than credible.
 standing in the shadows, listening with some concern.
 What happened to the sword?
 as Worf approaches the door to his quarters.
 Worf has moved away from Ba'el, doesn't face her. She walks toward him, perplexed by his attitude.
 as it hangs in space.
 as Picard ENTERS from the Ready Room and joins Riker and GEORDI at an Aft Science station.
 Establishing.
 Ba'el is tidying up somewhat aimlessly, lost in thought. There is a knock at the door. She opens it and sees Worf standing there. She doesn't let him in.
 as Worf comes out from the quarters. He looks around the compound and his eye is caught by something familiar about a GAME a group of young people are playing.
 as he laughs at the preposterousness of the request.
 to include L'Kor, Toq and Worf.
 Toq is following Worf as he makes his way through the jungle. Worf carries a SPEAR; Toq has a DISRUPTOR. Worf is completely involved in tracking his game and takes no notice of Toq's uneasiness.
 to indicate the passage of time.
 as Worf and Toq move with great stealth into a small clearing. All their attention is focused on the brush ahead of them, as if their quarry were just beyond it.
 Where the Klingons and Romulans have gathered to eat. Tokath sits with the Klingon Elders at the head of the table, Gi'ral and Ba'el sit nearby. Over the years, the Klingons have learned to eat with less boisterousness than is typical.
 Later. The room has been cleared; only Worf and Tokath remain, facing off. Tokath regards Worf solemnly for a beat, then paces away from him, musing, troubled.
 Worf is alone, doing the forms of the Mok'bara... preparing to meet death.
 Everyone in the camp is gathered in the central square. They wait, talking quietly among themselves.
 as he emerges from a barrack dressed in full battle regalia. He is wearing the armor from the chest that Ba'el showed Worf.
 Toq starts over to where Worf is standing against the wall. Tokath eyes him with barely controlled rage. Toq speaks out in a loud, clear voice.
 who stands at a distance, her parents on either side of her, staring at Worf. Their eyes lock together.
 as it travels at impulse.
 Picard, Riker, Data and various N.D's. Data responds to something on his monitor.
 as it hangs in space near a Romulan scout ship.
 Picard, BEVERLY and a Transporter Chief are at the control console. A group of young Klingons is being led out the door by an N.D.. We HEAR the sound of materialization.
 where Worf, Toq, and two young Klingons are on the platform. Beverly scans them.
 Picard regards Worf, a smile on his face.
 as it moves away we...
 docked at a GIANT ARRAY of some kind in orbit above a planet. The ship is sandwiched between two banks of reflector dishes.
 We see the commotion of evacuation, N.D.s crisscrossing in the corridor. PICARD, rounds the corner, a purposefulness in his stride. He soon encounters TROI, PADD in hand, waiting to speak with him. They talk on the move.
 The doors whoosh open and RIKER steps off... just in time to intercept the approaching Picard. Behind Riker, the Turbolift doors close.
 We see DATA inside.
 Picard and Data ENTER to find the last leg of a frenetic race: Bridge regulars and a handful of N.D.s shutting down consoles. Picard is set upon simultaneously by Geordi and Worf.
 Picard ENTERS, goes behind his desk, and activates the terminal.
 Picard ENTERS to find it... empty. It takes him a moment to adjust. He walks around, drinks in the solitude, savors it. Finally, he sits in his chair. A long, quiet beat...
 Suddenly, the fore and aft Turbolifts OPEN and SIX TECHNICIANS ENTER the Bridge: four humanoids -- KELSEY, NEIL, POMET and DEVOR and two aliens -- SATLER, and KIROS. (Full descriptions to follow later in the script). They are all wearing plain-looking overalls and two of them are carrying FIELD DIVERTERS -- about the size and shape of a trash can -- while the others carry Tricorders and other pieces of equipment.
 He stops and gives one last look around. So much for peace and quiet. And as he ENTERS the Turbolift...
 A lone outpost in the middle of nowhere...
 A festive reception is underway. There's a CONTROL PANEL at one end, but the room otherwise has a party feel to it. There are tables of food. A WAITER circulates with drinks. ORTON can be seen in the b.g.
 As he works the room. Hutchinson is a middle-aged, jovial man who lives for gatherings like this and loves nothing more than to entertain a starship crew. Data is quietly observing Hutchinson's technique and he unobtrusively follows the gregarious Commander about the room, watching and learning.
 As Riker moves over to stand with Beverly. Riker gives her a look and she smiles in commiseration.
 Hutchinson is going on as Picard looks for a way out.
 The door to Picard's quarters opens and Picard ENTERS the corridor, his saddle slung over his shoulder. He has now changed into civilian clothes -- casual work clothes with a jacket.
 A wall panel just above floor level has been removed, some fiber-optic cables yanked out. Picard approaches, sets his saddle down and kneels to inspect the open panel. Suddenly --
 Picard is moving fast when he hears voices ahead. He slows and squeezes back against the side wall.
 Kelsey and Neil round the bend headed in the same direction Picard was going. They don't see Picard, but they've unwittingly cut him off.
 Frustration shows on his face. He waits a beat, then turns and heads back the way he came.
 Picard comes around a corner fast.
 Working feverishly, he sets the controls.
 Green energy beams emit from each side of the array. They converge in a two-dimensional field that slices through a cross-section of the ship at the tail end of the nacelles.
 As he leaps up onto the stage the Transporter begins to power up...
 The reception continues. Data's chatting up a non-appreciative Orton. Orton is a native Arkarian and is the Chief Administrator for the base. He carries himself like an upper-class butler in the face of Data's stream of small talk (he's probably had practice at this with Hutchinson).
 Riker has been waylaid by Hutchinson.
 On feet dragging. WIDEN to see Picard pulling Devor toward Sickbay.
 Picard drags Devor inside and sets him down. He goes to a supply cabinet and gets out a hypospray and a phaser... suddenly he HEARS STATIC...
 The communicator strapped to his upper arm crackles to life...
 Revealing that Picard has just hyposprayed Devor.
 Picard is cautiously moving through the Corridor, trying to be quiet and avoid running into anyone.
 Picard moves into an alcove where there is a Turbolift entrance. He looks around and then pulls out his door-opening device. He opens the door to the Turbolift, then puts the device back in his pocket.
 He reaches up to the ceiling and starts to open the hatch... suddenly a WEAPON is put to the back of his head.
 Revealing Kiros standing in the Corridor holding the weapon to Picard's head.
 The ongoing reception. Hutchinson and Data are still at it -- they feed off each other, and the feeling here is almost that of one-upsmanship.
 who is watching Data and Hutchinson from across the room. Troi moves to him and follows his gaze.
 who is piling some food onto a plate from one of the tables. The Waiter seen earlier is standing nearby. Geordi suddenly frowns and looks down at the table in puzzlement. He puts his hand on the table, feeling it for heat. The Waiter immediately moves next to him.
 The conversation between Geordi and Orton has gotten Riker's attention. He frowns.
 We'll look into it. You don't have to concern yourself.
 reaches under the food cart and yanks out an ALIEN PHASER from the hidden compartment. He FIRES at Riker, narrowly missing him. Riker dives for cover.
 shoves Geordi out of the way and grabs his own weapon.
 react to the attack.
 recovers and goes for Orton, but the Waiter FIRES a burst into his chest, knocking him unconscious.
 Goes for the Waiter, but now Orton has his phaser out and he FIRES at Hutchinson.
 Orton and the Waiter now have the entire room under their weapons.
 The rays are halfway through the Enterprise's nacelles...
 The room has been taken over by the terrorists. A field diverter is sitting between the engine core and the pool table and there are many pieces of odd equipment lying about. The entire engine core is off. Pomet and Satler are working on open Mees panels located on the upper level of Engineering.
 Kelsey is standing beside Neil, who is working on an open Mees panel on the bulkhead near the pool table. Kelsey is a tall, striking woman with an almost feline grace and power. She is observing Neil as he makes some adjustments to the circuitry with a DEVICE. Neil is slightly built and has a nervous demeanor.
 Pomet and Satler work for a moment and then the center of the core and the side tubes come to life with a low hum.
 Neil is pleased.
 Picard watches as Kelsey moves toward Pomet, who has come down from the upper level of Engineering and is working on a thermos-sized trilithium resin containment unit.
 When Kelsey says the word "trilithium" Picard reacts with dismay.
 The hostages are standing in different parts of the room. Orton is maintaining his cool composure, watching the hostages with a calm expression while the Waiter patrols the room occasionally.
 Standing near Troi. They converse sotto voice...
 Picard is still sitting against a bulkhead. Satler is standing guard over him, but he's not paying strict attention to this mild-mannered "barber".
 Kelsey is watching Pomet attach the thermos-storage unit seen earlier to an interface inside the box on the side of the large vertical cylinder which is right behind the engine core. Pomet makes a few adjustments, then a LIGHT comes on the thermos.
 is watching Satler (his guard) carefully. Satler's attention is on the operation near the core.
 as he carefully takes the laser-torch out from where he had concealed it in the back of his shirt.
 Satler is still unaware of what Picard is doing. Picard glances down to his left.
 as he places the tip of the laser-torch directly next to a small sensor which is set into the bulkhead.
 He glances at Satler... then glances at the ceiling.
 as Picard ACTIVATES the torch and it DISCHARGES against the sensor.
 There is a pause, then suddenly vast quantities of GAS begin to flood the compartment, ALARMS SOUND, and the ISOLATION DOOR begins CLOSING.
 is trying to get control of the situation. She yells over the sound of the alarms and tries to see through the clouds of gas.
 presses the laser torch against the side of the diverter and activates it. The diverter goes DEAD. Picard ducks under the Isolation door and heads for the Jefferies Tube.
 recovers and goes after Picard, barely making it under the door before it closes completely.
 Picard's now in a horizontal section, scrambling through for all he's worth.
 Satler is scrambling after Picard, with his weapon in hand.
 is moving quickly around a corner. He comes to a hatch, opens it...
 The BARYON SWEEP -- a transparent sheet of green is flickering on and off directly ahead of Picard.
 He's trapped... the field is ahead of him and Satler is behind him. Off his expression...
 Satler comes around the corner and sees the now closed hatch where Picard was at the end of Act Three. Directly in front of the hatch, Picard's jacket is lying on the floor of the tube. Satler moves to the jacket and picks it up...
 The jacket was hiding a manhole-sized hole cut into the floor of the tube.
 She's looking down the hole. A sudden o.c. HUM makes her look up just in time to see the green BARYON SWEEP come through the closed hatch directly toward her. There is no time to escape.
 Picard, now without his jacket, runs down the corridor... over which we HEAR Satler's brief, painful SCREAM in the b.g.. Picard's expression acknowledges this as he keeps on.
 The Isolation door has been reopened, the gas is gone and the alarms have been turned off. Kelsey is standing over Neil, who is examining the deactivated field diverter. After a beat, Neil shakes his head and lets out a long breath in resignation.
 As Pomet comes out of the Jefferies Tube.
 Pomet has handed her a Starfleet combadge.
 Kelsey's face darkens with the realization that they're facing a formidable opponent.
 Picard rounds the corner and stops at a particular room. He uses his door-opener to get in.
 Picard ENTERS what we immediately recognize as WORF'S ROOM, replete with Klingon weapons on the wall. He begins to examine the weapons, trying to decide which ones will be the most useful. The alien communicator squawks in his pocket and he takes it out to listen.
 Kelsey's on the communicator. Neil and Pomet are working with the thermos and the open panel behind the engine core.
 Picard puts the communicator back in his pocket and slings the crossbow over his shoulder and grabs some arrows before EXITING.
 Kelsey moves to where Neil is working on the thermos, which is still attached to the open panel behind the core. A few blinkies on the side of the thermos are winking on and off, indicating that it is active. Neil works for a moment with a DEVICE... then seems satisfied.
 on the pin in Neil's hand. It is about the size and shape of a grenade pin, with a small ring at one end.
 Neil carefully inserts it into the thermos... there is an audible CLICK and a GREEN LIGHT comes on the thermos.
 The energy beams have reached the aft end of the saucer.
 Picard is dipping an arrow tip into a VIAL of colored liquid. He then loads the arrow into the crossbow.
 Kelsey and Neil are climbing up a vertical section of tube. Kelsey is in the lead, with Neil behind her. The thermos is strapped onto Neil's back.
 Revealing that all the ladder rungs above Kelsey are GONE. She looks at the remains of one of the rungs.
 The two stubs jutting out from the wall of the Jefferies Tube are burnt and melted, as if cut with a torch.
 Her face darkens.
 Picard is now carefully pouring a small amount of WHITE POWDER from a container into a petri dish. The communicator in his pocket suddenly crackles to life.
 As Kelsey and Neil come down off the ladder and then move through a section of horizontal tube. Kelsey is talking into her communicator.
 Riker is casually watching Beverly and Geordi from across the room. Beverly is kneeling next to Geordi, working on his VISOR. After a beat, she puts the VISOR down, says something quietly to Geordi and then moves to rejoin the others.
 Gets up and moves toward Orton who watches him carefully.
 As she adjusts the VISOR. A brief rainbow BURST OF LIGHT comes out and then disappears.
 is picked up off the floor by the Waiter who holds him.
 The BARYON BEAM is now halfway through the saucer section.
 Pomet is walking carefully through the corridor... looking for Picard with his weapon in hand. He approaches an intersection... begins to turn the corner, then stops as he hears something behind him. He doesn't turn right away... takes a another couple of steps forward, as if he didn't hear anything... then suddenly whirls around.
 Looking down the empty corridor. There's no one there.
 He's annoyed... thought he heard something, he begins to turn around and as he does we RACK FOCUS to see Picard, several feet down the corridor. He's already got the crossbow aimed.
 FIRES the crossbow.
 is HIT in the leg with the arrow. He yells out in pain, but it's not a mortal wound and he whips up his weapon to fire back at Picard. But suddenly he pauses... dizzy... can't see straight... and he collapses to the ground.
 as he runs to Pomet. He checks the man's pulse -- alive -- and then moves to remove the weapon from Pomet's reflexive grip. But before he can, there's another weapon prodding the back of his head.
 Kiros has gotten the drop on Picard! Off Picard...
 Picard is standing with his hands on his head, facing away from Kiros, who never takes his eyes off him as he activates his communicator.
 Kelsey and Neil are climbing up another tube.
 The green field is now three quarters of the way through the saucer section.
 The door to the Jefferies Tube OPENS and Kelsey crawls out into the corridor. Neil follows her, breathing heavily.
 takes off the thermos and bends over, catching his breath.
 Picard and Kiros come about the corner just as Kelsey shuts the door to the Jefferies Tube. The thermos is on the deck... Neil is nowhere to be seen. Kelsey turns as they approach.
 Riker is sitting at one of the tables, his face is slightly bloodied and bruised. Troi dabs a cloth to one of the cuts.
 activates the VISOR.
 a VERY LOW HUM can be heard... Orton looks up in curiosity... then suddenly he (and everyone else in the room) puts his hands to his head in confusion... and sinks to the floor, unconscious. Everyone follows suit, leaving only Data awake. He moves quickly to the computer panel.
 The sheet of green is almost through the saucer section.
 Picard, Kiros and Kelsey move along at a clip. Picard's trying to figure things out... but also trying to keep his captors off-center, look for an opening.
 as they ENTER single file: Picard, Kiros, then Kelsey. Kiros's weapon is steady on Picard's back and Kelsey is looking around for a possible trap.
 He steps squarely into a strip of WHITE POWDER on the ground... then carefully side-steps a strip of BLACK POWDER which is just ahead of it.
 follows Picard warily.
 as Kiros steps first onto the white, then directly onto the black powder with the same foot. As soon as his foot touches the second strip of powder, the chemicals react and there is an EXPLOSION.
 As the explosion blows Kiros against the wall, knocking her out. Picard takes advantage of the explosion and whirls around... he lunges at Kelsey and knocks her to the ground. She loses her grip on the thermos.
 Bounces across the floor.
 As Picard moves for Kiros's weapon, which is on the floor, but Kelsey recovers quickly and she catches him with a well-placed kick. Suddenly a noise makes both of them stop for a moment and turn toward the back wall.
 As the BARYON SWEEP suddenly comes THROUGH the wall.
 Kelsey and Picard react to the sight. Then Kelsey swings at Picard and they begin to fight across the room toward the windows... only a few feet ahead of the BARYON SWEEP.
 Picard looks around... trying to think of some way out. But there's nowhere for him to go. He climbs up on a window support, giving him a few extra seconds, but the sweep is getting every closer. He adjusts the communicator for a moment.
 Data is at the computer panel. Riker is keeping guard on Orton and the Waiter in the b.g. and everyone looks a little woozy still.
 he's holding the safety pin from the thermos which he had surreptitiously removed during the scuffle.
 Off his grim expression...
 The Enterprise is still docked. It's all lit up, per normal operation. The array is turned off.
 Beverly is patching up Picard's bumps and bruises with a medical DEVICE.
 It is the night watch -- DATA sits in the command chair; N.D.'s man the various vital stations. PICARD ENTERS from the Turbolift, preoccupied with the PADD in his hand.
 Picard sits at his desk and puts down the PADD. After a beat, he activates his DESKTOP TERMINAL.
 Picard approaches the door to the Stellar Sciences Department. He EXITS to...
 The room is pitch black, lit only by the light from the corridor as Picard ENTERS. Startled by the sudden blackness, he stops short in the open doorway.

 RIKER, Data and various N.D.s. Picard ENTERS from the Ready Room.
 Picard and BEVERLY are sharing an afternoon lunch, chatting about this and that.
 TROI, GEORDI, Riker, Picard and Beverly are sitting among the N.D.'s waiting for the performance to start. People talk quietly among themselves as they wait.

 Riker, Data, and various N.D.'s. Nella ENTERS from the Turbolift and approaches Riker.
 It's evening. Picard is holding his flute, listening to a playback of a recording he just made. He is dressed comfortably, a cup of tea on a nearby table. The door CHIMES.
 The Enterprise hanging in space near the nebula.
 Riker, Data, and various N.D.s. Riker nods that a PADD an N.D. is showing him checks out fine, then moves to sit in the command chair. After a moment, Picard ENTERS from his Ready Room. He's full of energy and seems to be in a great mood.
 Nella is being examined by Beverly, who waves a SCANNER over her right arm from elbow to wrist.
 Open on the rungs of the ladder. A woman's hand comes into frame, then another. She's climbing up. Then Nella's body passes. She carries a small BAG slung over one shoulder, and is dressed in civilian clothes.
 It is the intersection of a vertical and horizontal tube. Nella climbs into the horizontal tube and scoots over to make room for Picard.
 Geordi works alone at a CONSOLE. He hears something. MUSIC? How can that be? He walks around the room slowly. Where can it be coming from? Finally, he leans into a Jefferies Tube and puts his head up the shaft.

 Picard and Nella are exchanging a warm and deep kiss.

 Picard -- now in uniform -- Riker, Troi, Worf and various N.D.'s. Geordi ENTERS from the Turbolift and approaches Riker, who is at aft science with an N.D.
 Picard and Troi have settled into the couch. Picard lets out a breath, prepares himself for what he has to say.

 as it drops out of warp.
 Picard, Riker, Beverly, Data, Geordi, Nella and an N.D. colleague (Marquez) have assembled to discuss the situation.
 The Enterprise slides into orbit above the planet. On the surface, the mammoth firestorm appears as a huge hurricane of flashing fire and boiling black smoke.
 ON THE MOVE with Riker and Picard as they discuss final preparations.
 The Transporter pad is filled with N.D. team members awaiting transport. Nella is among them, loaded with equipment. As Picard and Riker ENTER, the first officer heads onto the pad to take his place.
 as it orbits Bersallis Three. The dark red area of firestorm activity has now grown significantly larger, engulfing as large an area as a hurricane would on Earth.
 Picard is in the command chair; all stations are manned. There is an undercurrent of shared concern for those who face the real danger -- the colonists and members of the crew on the planet.
 where Geordi is working at the transporter control circuitry on the far side of the room. An N.D. is working the transporter controls.
 to include the six people who have just been brought aboard. The look of relief on their faces is evident, mixed with concern for their friends still on the surface.
 Two N.D. crewmembers, Richardson and Deng, are working near a rock face; each is setting up a DEFLECTOR UNIT. The units are cylindrical, and have a tripod base; they are capped by an emitter array, which lights up when the unit is activated.
 Picard is standing between Ops and the Helm.
 Not the one Geordi was in; a different N.D. is manning the controls. Beverly has come aboard with some infirmary patients, who are being led away by N.D. personnel.
 Understood, Doctor.
 The wind has picked up and Nella has to shout to be heard.
 I don't know, sir. For a few minutes... maybe.
 Nella and crew receive Picard's static-ridden communique with grim faces.
 Picard's look reflects his concern. He may just have condemned Nella to death.
 Nella is scanning the invisible deflector field with her tricorder. She gets a troubling reading.
 as she reacts to what she sees.
 Nella's POV of the approaching FIRESTORM. The deflector field FRITZES on for a moment -- it seems scant protection from the immense angry cloud of flame that is bearing down on them... there's no way out.
 Picard and Worf are at an aft station, looking at the OKUDAGRAM seen earlier.
 we can only imagine what he's going through.

 Riker is seated on an examining table, being attended to by Beverly. All background beds are filled.
 Picard is very much alone. He sits very still. Silence.

 Nella sits opposite Picard. Although it's an informal setting, she is reporting to him almost as if they were in the Observation lounge. Both are in uniform.
 as it moves away.
 The ship moving at impulse against softly glowing bands of gaseous material.
 PICARD, TROI, WORF are at their stations; DATA is at the aft science station, working his console.
 Picard ENTERS from the Bridge -- his attention is immediately riveted toward an OBJECT on the middle of the table. It is a TERRA-COTTA FIGURINE, roundish, about a foot wide and tall, of vaguely HUMANOID shape, with a serene look on its face -- like some alien Buddha. Its surface is worn, it looks ancient.
 PROFESSOR GALEN is in his sixties, tall, slender, greyhaired, and seems to emanate dignity and intelligence. Riker has a smile on his face.
 The Enterprise at impulse speed in the protostar nebula.
 Picard is at a table having tea with Professor Galen. The Captain doesn't frequent Ten Forward, and draws a few curious glances from the other patrons.
 At impulse in the protostar nebula.
 Picard is at a table, staring into space. The ancient FIGURINE is in front of him, open, the tiny figures visible inside. The door CHIMES.
 Professor Galen is working at a console. A mid-sized Viewscreen displays a star chart, color-coded for political boundaries.
 The Enterprise at warp.
 Picard, Riker, Worf, Data and Troi.
 Professor Galen is staring at them, fear in his eyes, the interior of his Federation shuttle in the background.
 At high warp across a field of stars.
 Picard, Riker, Worf, Data and Troi. The tension is high.
 A Federation shuttle is close to a YRIDIAN ATTACK SHIP -- much smaller than the Enterprise, but wasp-like and deadly-looking.
 The Enterprise fires a short phaser blast that hits the Yridian ship -- it violently EXPLODES.
 The Bridge crew reacts with surprise as the Enterprise is shaken by the shock wave.
 The door opens and Picard rushes inside.
 Picard and Worf are at the table. Data and Geordi are at the far end, near the Viewscreen.
 The screen displays a BLOCK of RAW NUMBERS.
 The Enterprise is entering orbit above a blue-green, earth-like planet.
 Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, Troi and the Ensign at the CONN. The Viewscreen displays the blue-green planet.
 The Enterprise at warp speed across a field of stars.
 Picard is staring at the small COMPUTER on his desk. A NUMBER BLOCK seen before in the Observation Lounge briefing is displayed on the screen. He taps the keyboard and the screen displays a different number block. The Professor's FIGURINE gift is now on a shelf in the background. The door CHIMES.
 Riker, Data, Worf and the Ensign.
 The green planet is slowly turning brown before their eyes, changing color along a single front.
 The ship is in orbit around the burned out planet.
 As before.
 Picard and Beverly are watching the Viewscreen anxiously. The number block is shifting and changing as the computer searches for a match. Finally, the screen stops and the number block is matched side by side next to an identical number block.
 Which is showing the same geometric matrix just seen in the Lab. Geordi and Data are talking to Picard and Beverly.
 Still in orbit above the now dead Indri Eight.
 Beverly is removing a sampling DEVICE from the arm of one ALIEN CREWMEMBER who is sitting on the bed. MOTT, the barber, is standing in the vestibule, waiting.
 Beverly is with Picard, who is pacing.
 At high warp speed.
 Picard, Riker, Worf, Data and the Ensign.
 TWO CARDASSIAN VESSELS are in orbit above the planet.
 The ship hanging in space, in a stand-off with two Cardassian battleships and one Klingon bird of prey.
 Picard is at the table with the Klingon, NU'DAQ, and the Cardassian, Gul Ocett.
 The screen shows the partly assembled ancient program we've seen before. It is obvious that several "pieces" are missing.
 Data is sitting at a table, working on a PADD. The Klingon Captain steps up to him.
 Geordi is going about his standard work routine. As he passes a console something catches his eye.
 The Klingon and two Cardassian ships are close by.
 Picard and the Klingon and Cardassian Captains are watching the Viewscreen as Data and Beverly stand near the console.
 A map of our galactic neighborhood highlights two dozen evenly spaced stars -- which form an image closely resembling the design of the computer "program" formed by the DNA fragments.
 Simultaneously fire point blank at the Enterprise and Klingon ship. The ships seem completely at their mercy. The firing continues.
 The Cardassians continue to fire on the Enterprise and the Klingon ship.
 Riker is in the command chair and Worf at tactical, the Ensign at the CONN. They seem unusually calm.
 Stop firing at the Enterprise and take off -- leaving the Klingon ship and the Enterprise apparently crippled.
 Picard, Data, Beverly and Nu'Daq ENTER from the Turbolift. They too seem calm.

 Riker, Data and Geordi. Geordi is filling in for Worf at Tactical.
 Picard, Worf, the Klingon Captain and Beverly are waiting. Picard carries a small COMPUTER-LIKE DEVICE; Beverly has a TRICORDER and a palm-sized SAMPLING INSTRUMENT.
 Riker, Data, and Geordi are facing the Viewscreen, which shows a barren, whitened planet.
 A dry, cracked, ancient seabed. Picard, Beverly, Worf and Nu'Daq suddenly MATERIALIZE. They spread out to search as Beverly quickly scans with her tricorder.
 As before, the Cardassians between the Away team and the rockface, Gul Ocett slowly backing toward it.
 The are standing off to one side, away from the standoff. As the Romulan, Cardassian, and Klingon continue their squabble in the b. g....
 There are imprints and fossilized remains of vegetation -- it should look like a "mold" of a leaf or fern. There should be a hint of greenish-brown coloring left on the imprints.
 The seabed... it may be only partially fossilized... it could still contain organic material.
 THIS SCENE IS THE BACKGROUND DIALOGUE TO BE PLAYED UNDER SCENES 60 AND 62.
 Picard is working the small computer -- Beverly's sampling device is now attached to it. Picard reacts to what he sees on the tiny screen.
 The Romulans have their four weapons trained on the Klingon Captain, but he's not budging. A beat, then Worf steps up next to the Klingon, phaser ready. Another beat, Gul Ocett and her Cardassian guard take a couple of steps, adding their weapons to the side of the Romulans. It is now six against two.
 activates a control on the small computer, aiming it toward the middle of the fray.
 Picard's computer SUDDENLY PROJECTS A HOLOGRAM directly into the middle of the scene. It is a HUMANOID -- in fact, one of the coolest humanoids we've ever seen, with a face wise and tragic and light-hearted all at once. It appears as if the flesh is life-like. Everyone reacts, staring with amazement as it addresses them.
 still in orbit above the planet.
 Picard and Beverly are at the end of their morning tea; musing about the last few days.
 as he turns toward it. The face of the Romulan Captain appears.
 An austere room -- devoid of furnishings, except for a BED and a DOOR with a small thick-paned window. RIKER is sitting on the bed, dressed in casual hospital-type clothing. He is trying to maintain control, but there is an underlying tension. He looks strung out, like he's been at this for a long time...
 to REVEAL that we have been in the ship's THEATER. A cell is set up on a stage. The theater seats are empty, except for BEVERLY, who is directing the play. DATA -- who is playing the Doctor -- is also on the cell stage.
 A few minutes later. Riker walking along, still dressed in his inmate costume. He's practicing lines from his final speech, trying to get it right.
 Riker and PICARD standing at the desk, looking at a terminal.
 Later. Riker and WORF standing at the wall MONITOR, which displays an AERIAL MAP of TILONUS FOUR. Worf points to a specific region on the map.
 Riker sitting on a bed; Beverly HEALING his head wound with a medical device.
 Later. Riker and TROI sitting at the bar, drinks in front of them. Riker is troubled by the day's events.
 of the strange, alien Lieutenant (as seen in the Teaser). He is sitting across the room, alone at a table, staring at Riker with his expressionless face. He stands and heads for the door...
 Riker turns to Troi.
 The austere set, as seen in the Teaser. But now there is a full AUDIENCE -- Picard, Beverly, Worf, Troi, Geordi and several other crewmembers and civilians are watching, engrossed.

 The alien Lieutenant is now standing next to Picard. He is staring directly at Riker... eyes intense... face cold... and he is not applauding...
 reacts to the sight, startled. He takes a final bow...
 As Riker stands. THE AUDIENCE IS GONE AND THERE IS A CELL WALL IN ITS PLACE. The cheering has stopped -- silence.
 reacts and spins around --
 we are now in an ACTUAL ASYLUM CELL. Similar to the set but clearly a real place. Riker is completely stunned. From offscreen:
 is standing nearby -- a species we've never seen before. A real Doctor. OFF Riker's shock and confusion...
 Riker is glancing around the room, trying to make sense out of the situation. He turns to the Doctor.
 Riker, the Attendant and the Guard walking along. The hall is ascetic, lined with CELL DOORS on either side, each with an inset window pane. They pass another inmate, who is being led along by an Attendant. Somewhere in the distance, a brief YELL echoes through the corridors. Riker takes it all in, unsettled by the chilly environment.
 He looks exactly like the alien Lieutenant seen earlier. He passes Riker without so much as a glance...
 reacts. As the Guard leads him around a corner...
 A large room that is brighter and more colorful than the cell and the corridor. There are windows... plants... several tables and activities for the patients. One inmate is painting a bizarre PICTURE... two other inmates are sitting together, engaged in a hushed conversation... another sits alone, staring into middle-distance, slowly rocking back and forth...
 Riker bolts awake in his bed, as if from a nightmare. He's dressed in his nightclothes... sweating... rattled by the dream. He glances around the room in momentary confusion... but there's no one there. He's safely aboard the Enterprise. OFF his shaken expression...
 Riker is standing in the bathroom, dressed in his INMATE COSTUME, looking in the mirror. He is preparing himself for that evening's performance of the play. Everything appears to be normal. Beverly stands nearby, listening to Riker recall his "dream."
 Mid-performance -- the same scene from Teaser and Act One. There's a full AUDIENCE -- Picard, Beverly, Worf, Troi, Geordi, etc. They are engrossed.

 looks back toward Mavek -- he is gone. Riker hesitates, unsettled... but his instincts quickly kick in and he continues...
 THE AUDIENCE IS GONE. In its place is an ASYLUM CELL WALL.
 can't believe his eyes. He looks to Data, who stares back at him as if nothing is wrong.
 In the audience, sitting next to Picard, is the alien Lieutenant. He stares at Riker, expressionless.

 Later. Riker sitting on a bio-bed; Beverly scanning him with a medical tricorder.
 A few minutes later. Riker and Troi walking along. Troi is trying to ease Riker's mind.
 as he smiles -- feeling better. HOLD on Riker as he continues walking with Troi (who is now offscreen).
 She looks at him, puzzled.
 A few minutes later. Riker is trying to stay calm. After a beat, the lift STOPS and the doors OPEN to reveal --
 Riker walking down the hall, staring straight ahead, trying to maintain control. He passes a crewmember... walks a little further... then turns a corner...
 Riker turns the corner and stops at what he sees...
 Riker running down the hall... afraid... stops at the door to his quarters and hurries inside...
 As Riker ENTERS. The doors slide shut with the distinctive LOCKING SOUND (as heard in the Asylum Cell). Riker reacts to the noise -- turns to see:
 to REVEAL we are in the ASYLUM CELL. Riker is wearing the inmate clothing.
 A couple of hours have passed. Various inmates are around the room. Riker and Doctor Syrus sitting at a table. Riker looks exhausted -- at the breaking point.
 Riker is sitting on the bed, watching Doctor Syrus, who is placing a MEDICAL DEVICE on the floor. The device is a tall, sleek cylinder with several controls on the side.
 who is standing in the room -- a holographic image. Riker reacts.
 The Doctor deactivates the device and stands to go.
 The next day. Various inmates engaged in various activities. Riker sits alone at a table, eating food from a tray. A silent moment as he eats, then something across the room catches his eye...
 as she ENTERS the room. She is dressed in a hospital doctor's uniform and holds a note-taking device. Very official. She scans the room a moment, then spots Riker --
 Later. The room is dark. Riker is lying in bed, eyes closed, asleep. Gradually, a TAPPING NOISE can be heard somewhere in the darkness. Riker opens his eyes... listens a moment... then looks toward the door...
 Worf ENTERS the hall, looks around -- it's empty. Data ENTERS holding Riker tightly by the arm. They quickly move down the hall, Worf leading the way, keeping a look-out...
 As before. Worf and Data facing Mavek and the Guard. Riker looks on.
 After hours -- dark. Worf, Data and Riker ENTER and cross to the middle of the room, where THREE PATTERN ENHANCER DEVICES have been set up (as seen in "Power Play"). Worf activates one of the enhancers and they create a TRIANGLE OF LIGHT. Worf pulls out a communicator.
 A few hours later. Picard looks on as Beverly scans Riker with a medical tricorder.
 AS THE ENTIRE ROOM SHATTERS LIKE BREAKING GLASS AROUND RIKER -- "REALITY" BREAKING APART -- THE SCENE SPLINTERING AWAY TO REVEAL:
 Riker standing in the exact same position, arms hanging at his side -- his head wound is gone. The alien Lieutenant is standing in front of him, dressed as the hospital Administrator (as seen in Act Two). Doctor Syrus and Mavek stand nearby. Riker glances around, startled by the change in setting.
 As a trickle of blood runs down Riker's face -- THE WOUND HAS REAPPEARED ON HIS TEMPLE. Riker touches the wound, and it shocks him into awareness. He aims the phaser at the Attendant.
 as Riker presses a few buttons.
 I'm setting this to Level Sixteen, wide field. That should destroy half of this building... Unless, of course, it isn't a real phaser.
 AS THE ENTIRE ROOM SHATTERS LIKE BREAKING GLASS AROUND RIKER AND THE ALIEN ADMINISTRATOR/LIEUTENANT -- Riker (wound gone) and the Administrator/Lieutenant now standing face to face on the stage set. Riker looks around --
 Filled with people: Picard, Data, Worf, Geordi, Beverly, Troi -- the entire Enterprise crew, and more: Doctor Syrus, Mavek. Nearly everyone Riker saw during the last five Acts is present, watching the stage intently.
 as a trickle of blood runs down the side of his face. THE WOUND HAS REAPPEARED. Riker reacts, touches the wound. It seems to jolt him into awareness. He looks up, defiant.
 AS EVERYTHING SHATTERS LIKE BREAKING GLASS, INCLUDING RIKER AND THE ADMINISTRATOR/LIEUTENANT -- "REALITY" BREAKING APART ONE FINAL TIME TO REVEAL:
 Riker bolts awake. He looks around, sees that he is lying on an EXAMINATION TABLE. An alien MEDICAL APPARATUS is above him -- a PROBE is connected to the side of his head at the exact spot where the wound has appeared all along. He is dressed in the Tilonus merchant costume seen in Act One. He turns to see:
 It's a redress of the Asylum Cell -- rigged with various alien medical equipment. The Administrator/Lieutenant is working at a console that displays a GRAPHIC of a HUMAN BRAIN. The mood is different here -- THIS IS REALITY.
 at impulse.
 A couple of days have passed. Riker looks rested and in good health. He's sitting with Picard and Troi, midconversation.
 We believe they were trying to extract strategic information from your memory using a neuro-somatic technique.
 Riker and Beverly standing on the stage set. They are alone. Riker is eyeing the stage intently.
 at impulse.
 The doors slide OPEN and BEVERLY ENTERS, looking high strung and extremely agitated. She leans against the door, takes a breath... then tosses a medical PADD onto the couch. A beat passes by... then moves to a closet and pulls out a small suitcase... begins to pack some personal belongings...
 A few minutes later. Beverly is packing as Guinan looks on. Beverly is still very agitated. She keeps moving from the closet to the suitcase, messily stuffing clothing into the suitcase. Her tone is sarcastic and bitter.
 A laboratory with a number of consoles, monitors, etc. The various scientists are there, sitting and standing, as Beverly's V.O. continues.
 as they continue walking.
 PICARD, DATA, WORF, Beverly, and the four scientists -- T'Pan, Christopher, Reyga, and Kurak. They are scattered at the various Aft stations. Beverly is monitoring environmental conditions in the cabin.
 Jo'Bril is already on a bio-bed; Beverly and NURSE OGAWA are there, working on him. His eyes are open and he is drawing great ragged gasps of air.
 FADE IN:
 Beverly is still flinging things into her suitcases. Guinan is seated, feet up on a table, taking it all in.
 Beverly and NURSE OGAWA with Jo'Bril's body, underneath the medical scanner on the clamshell bed. Picard is just entering, Ogawa moving away with a sampling device in her hands. In the b.g., she begins working on a console.
 Beverly ENTERS to see REYGA'S SHUTTLE in the bay, its door open. Geordi is using a tricorder to scan the shuttle's hull and the area around the door.
 Beverly, Reyga, Kurak, T'Pan, and Christopher.
 FADE IN:
 Beverly and Worf are kneeling on the floor next to the body of Doctor Reyga. Beverly is scanning the body with her medical tricorder, and the ND security guards are in the b.g.
 Picard and Beverly.
 The ship's morgue is a fairly simple room with a bank of TILT-DOWN STASIS DRAWERS along one of the walls. A few pieces of medical equipment, consoles, wall panels, etc. are visible.
 Christopher and T'Pan with Beverly.
 Beverly ENTERS to find Kurak alone in the room, working at a terminal; an OKUDAGRAM of a shuttlecraft is displayed in a monitor.
 Beverly is alone, sitting on a stool, staring at the compartment that contains Reyga.
 DNA traces... tissue anomalies... a wealth of forensic clues that could shed some light on this mystery.
 So... I made the decision.
 Beverly stands outside Picard's quarters. She looks subdued and resigned as she hits the CHIME.
 as she ENTERS. Picard is working at his desk.
 Beverly snaps shut her suitcases with an air of finality.
 Beverly ENTERS and crosses to the shuttle. She reacts at the sight of the open rear doors... looks inside...
 Data is inside, working at the console. Beverly ENTERS the shuttle.
 Beverly is striding from the Shuttlebay back to Sickbay. Riker catches up with her.
 Beverly is at her desk terminal, holding a PADD. In the b.g. we see Ogawa approach and overhear.
 As Jo'Bril's body TILTS DOWN from its container. Ogawa and Beverly are there, positioning a MED (TECH) device over the body as it comes to a rest.
 Picard, TROI, Riker, Worf and Data at their stations.
 FADE IN:
 All eyes are on the Viewscreen.
 I think Reyga's shield does work.
 as it courses towards the sun's CORONA... closer and closer...
 Beverly at the controls.
 Beverly. What do you hope to accomplish?
 as it ENTERS THE SUN'S CORONA, COMPLETELY VANISHING INTO THE INTENSE LIGHT.
 It's the moment of truth. Everyone on the Bridge watches helplessly... A tense, silent beat...
 Beverly's also a little amazed -- and relieved. The view outside the shuttle's window is now nothing but an intense WHITE LIGHT growing steadily stronger.
 Reactions of relief and astonishment from the Bridge crew.
 Beverly reacts.

 As it TUMBLES through the corona, heading toward the sun...
 It's a mad scramble for the phaser. The shuttle continues to SHAKE.
 As before.
 As it EMERGES from the sun's CORONA...
 As before.
 as Beverly breathes a sigh of relief.
 Chief Medical Officer's log, Stardate 46831.2. I have been reinstated and will be resuming my duties shortly. In the meantime, I have a personal matter to attend to.
 Guinan is behind the bar... there are just a few people in the room. Beverly ENTERS carrying a nicely wrapped package, and heads for the bar.
 blasts into warp.
 The ship at warp.
 DATA is in command, with N.D. CREWMEMBERS at all other positions. RIKER and SEVERAL CREWMEMBERS ENTER from the fore and aft Turbolifts. It's time to change shifts and while Riker moves to Data, the other members of Riker's shift take over their positions from the people on Data's shift. No one moves to relieve the N.D. Ensign standing at Tactical.
 Riker and TWO N.D. SECURITY CREWMEMBERS move down the Corridor and come to a stop outside Worf's Quarters. The Security Officers take up positions on either side of Riker as he reaches for the door panel. He presses it... no response.
 As Riker and the two officers ENTER the room. The room is filled with acrid smoke and is lit only with dimly seen ceremonial candles. They look about for a moment, trying to peer through the gloom. Suddenly, they are startled by a throaty ROAR out of the darkness.
 Revealing WORF sitting cross-legged on the deck in his bedroom. He is wearing some kind of Klingon ceremonial robe and he is staring into a small FIRE which is blazing in a stone firepit that is sitting in the center of the bedroom. The look on his face is feral, intense... Klingon. This, combined with the red light of the fire, the smoke, and the dark shadows make this an almost satanic, other-worldly scene.
 The ship drops out of warp.
 Riker and PICARD are sitting at the desk.
 The smoke is gone, the normal lights are on, and the fire has been put out. Worf is lying on his bed, staring up at the ceiling. The door CHIMES. He hears it, but he seems listless, almost apathetic. The door CHIMES a second time.
 As Picard ENTERS. He looks around the room... the ritual candles, lava rocks, and remnants of the fire pit are all still in evidence. The room is a mess, with Klingon implements and clothes lying all over the place. Picard carefully picks his way through the detritus and moves toward the bedroom.
 The planet surface is mountainous... desolate... no cities or dwellings of any kind except for a single temple situated high up on the tallest mountaintop.
 His eyes are closed and he is sweating heavily.
 Worf is sitting cross-legged on the floor of the cave along with SEVERAL N.D. KLINGONS including one named TORIN. All are dressed in ceremonial robes and are sitting around a smoking fire pit with their eyes closed. There are candles and Klingon artifacts in evidence with smoke drifting throughout the cave. The heat is intense and the scene should look like an expanded and more traditional version of the scene in Worf's Quarters in the Teaser. They've all been here for several hours.
 A small, spartan room with a single hard bed, a bench and a crude chest. The building and furnishings are obviously quite old. It should look like a monk's room at a monastery. Worf is taking some personal items from the chest and packing them in his haversack. He is facing away from the open doorway when Koroth ENTERS.
 The Temple is more like a war room than a church. There are weapons on display everywhere, proud banners and emblems adorn the walls and the room is dominated at one end by a single ornate chair sitting on a raised platform. There is a bat'leth sword on the chair. There are a few spartan benches in the room.
 It is a heroic rendering of Kahless standing alone. He is dressed in a distinctive garment that is very different from the normal Klingon battledress. His features are clearly visible in the painting and he seems to beckoning someone to follow him. (Kahless lived centuries ago and so there should be no suggestion of anything remotely modern in the painting.)
 Worf studies the painting for a moment.
 Worf is sweating heavily as he concentrates... the smoke is thick in the air... Divok is sitting nearby watching and tending the fire.
 There is a long beat and then suddenly there is a SWIRL of SMOKE AND LIGHT on the opposite side of the fire from Worf. A FIGURE begins to COALESCE in the cave. Suddenly KAHLESS is standing before Worf in the cave. He is dressed in the same garments as seen in the painting. Worf's expression is one of awe and elation.
 Reacts to the sight with shock... how can he see Worf's vision?
 As Kahless blinks for a second. Worf does not see Divok RUN OUT of the cave in terror. Worf stands up, unaware that anything is wrong. Kahless looks around for a moment... then steps forward.
 As seen before.
 Kahless ENTERS from the Lava Caves. The crowd of Klingons seen at the end of Act One are all following him in silent amazement. Worf is bringing up the rear of the crowd, stunned and shocked... unsure what to think or believe.
 Revealing Koroth standing at the rear of the room, outrage clear on his face. The other Klingons exchange nervous glances among themselves and then part to let Koroth walk to the front of the room. Kahless faces Koroth calmly, confidently.
 Worf ENTERS and goes directly to his haversack and begins looking for something. He pulls out a tricorder just as Kahless ENTERS behind him.
 The ship at impulse.
 Picard, Riker, Data, and TROI are sitting at the table.
 As seen before.
 The temple is swarming with Klingons... a massive celebration is underway complete with ample food and bombastic Klingon opera filling the air. Tables and benches have been brought in to fill the area. A large stone cistern is filled with liquid of some type and various Klingons plunge goblets into it and then drink heartily. The room is festive, almost giddy with celebration as Klingons slap each other around in macho goodfellowship.
 Looks around for a beat... all eyes are on him. After a moment, Worf steps into the clearing and faces Kahless. Someone throws a bat'leth to Worf and he grips it tightly... they both tense and wait.
 Koroth moves closer. He looks from Worf to Kahless and back.
 The ship is orbiting Boreth.
 Worf's shuttlecraft has just landed in the bay. Picard, Riker, and Troi are waiting. The shuttlecraft door OPENS and Kahless ENTERS from the shuttlecraft, followed by Koroth, Torin and Worf.
 Picard, Riker, Troi, Data, GEORDI and BEVERLY are questioning Worf.
 The ship goes into warp.
 Like the Duras sisters...
 Worf is showing Kahless a ceremonial knife.
 Riker in command, Data at Ops.
 The Enterprise... moves close to a Klingon ATTACK CRUISER.
 Picard is standing near the platform as GOWRON and an N.D. Klingon Aide MATERIALIZE.
 Gowron, the Aide, and Picard ENTER from the Transporter Room.
 Kahless, Koroth, Torin, and Worf are listening to Picard.
 It is very old and stained with blood. A HAND enters the frame and waves a medical SCANNER over it. MOVE TO REVEAL that we're in:
 Beverly is scanning the knife with the scanner and holding her tricorder in the other hand. Gowron, the Aide, Worf, and Picard are watching. She finishes the scan.
 As Beverly moves to the large wall monitor and activates it. The screen is scrolling two DNA IMAGES side by side... scanning them and comparing them. Everyone watches the screen anxiously. Finally the scan is complete and the image stops scrolling. The two DNA patterns are identical.
 Koroth and Torin are looking over some PADDS at a table. The door CHIMES.
 Revealing that Kahless has just ENTERED from the bedroom. He smiles warmly and clasps Worf on the shoulder in goodfellowship.
 Worf is standing at the window looking out into space in the same position that we just left Kahless. Gowron is sitting at the table. Worf's expression is eager and optimistic.
 The two ships hang in space together.
 Worf and Koroth are walking toward the Holodeck. Koroth is disturbed.
 The Holodeck has recreated the same Temple as seen earlier. Koroth and Worf ENTER and find Data and Torin waiting for them. Koroth moves to speak privately with Torin, while Data approaches Worf.
 Just as Gowron (wearing his cloak), and SEVERAL N.D. KLINGONS ENTER from the Corridor. They are escorted by THREE N.D. ENTERPRISE SECURITY GUARDS. Gowron and Koroth trade spiteful looks.
 There is no future here... no glorious new era for our people. Gowron was right, you don't know the name of the man who faced the storm... you don't even know what real Warnog tastes like... and you certainly are not the greatest warrior of all. Whoever you are... you're not Kahless.
 The two ships as seen before.
 The Temple as seen before. Worf ENTERS and sees TWO N.D. KLINGONS sitting cross-legged on the floor in front of the Kahless painting with a couple of lighted candles and Klingons artifacts in front of them. Worf is surprised to see them here... he begins to move closer to them, but before getting there, he hears Data's voice.
 Including Data, who is sitting on one of the back benches, observing.
 Gowron and Koroth are both trying to browbeat Picard into agreeing to their requests while Kahless sits at the table in silence... a man watching others argue over his fate. TWO N.D. SECURITY GUARDS stand watch in the b.g.
 Worf is saying good-bye to Kahless.
 The Klingon ship peels off from the Enterprise and leaves.
 as it orbits a planet whose atmosphere shimmers with a strange luminescence.
 It is Jazz Night. RIKER is in civilian clothes playing the trombone in a quartet. N.D. Supernumeraries sit at tables listening and talking quietly among themselves. It is a casual setting, with N.D. Waiters moving around as the music plays.
 It is the night shift; DATA and various N.D.'s. Riker ENTERS from the Turbolift and moves to aft-science where Data is working.
 as it orbits the planet.
 GEORDI is doing a last minute check on the Transporter system. A transport technician, ENSIGN PALMER is at one of the side panels adjacent to the Transporter chamber, assisting him. Riker, Data, and WORF ENTER with an N.D. technician.
 as the away team MATERIALIZES on the station's transporter pad (the pad is not operational -- it is merely a convenient place to beam in).
 Both Rikers in frame. The two men look at each other in amazement. Off this moment we...
 The second Riker looks very much like Commander Riker except his beard is a little fuller, his hair a little wilder, and his face a little more weathered. He wears simple civilian clothes that are slightly soiled here and there, as if he's been working in them.
 as we hear the SOUND of DEMATERIALIZATION. He doesn't know what to make of all this. When his double is gone, he casts a glance at Data.
 as it orbits the planet.
 where Beverly is checking out Lieutenant Riker. TWO SECURITY GUARDS hang back by the door. He is sitting on the table, watching her as she works. As she raises her scanner upwards their eyes meet for a moment. This is very strange for her -- in a way she feels that she knows this man, but of course she doesn't.
 Geordi is reporting his findings to Picard, Commander Riker, Data, Beverly and Troi.
 Lieutenant Riker is cleaned up, now wearing a gold Lieutenant's Uniform. He is sitting at a table, looking at the screen of a desktop terminal. A now empty dinner plate is pushed off to the side. He takes a sip from his beverage as he studies the screen.
 that includes the screen. We see that he is looking over Commander Riker's service record, finding out what his double has been up to these past eight years.
 as Troi pulls back from him.
 as it orbits the planet.
 Riker, Data, Worf and an N.D. technician are getting ready to go, doing a final check on the equipment they're bringing down in carrying cases. Geordi is at working at one of the side panels adjacent to the Transporter chamber; Ensign Palmer is at the main console.
 as the Away Team MATERIALIZES. Most of the station's consoles are still down, but the lights are now on. The N.D. technician sets about her task. Lieutenant Riker moves toward the lit center console.
 Riker, Worf and Data.

 There's a tone in Lieutenant Riker's voice that Riker isn't sure he likes.
 FADE IN:
 as she ENTERS, coming home from duty. She crosses toward the replicator.
 As Troi reads:
 Troi thinks a moment -- what's this all about? Curiosity gets the best of her; she sets down her tea and EXITS...
 Moments later. Troi ENTERS and looks around -- there's nobody here. Then she sees an ORCHID sitting on the Transporter console. She smiles and picks it up... there is another tiny scroll attached. She smells the flower... then unravels the scroll and reads the handwritten note:
 Geordi and a few N.D.s working. Troi ENTERS and looks around, then heads toward the main core where the dilithium chamber is located.
 Troi stops outside Engineering and unrolls the scroll...
 as Troi ENTERS and looks around... moves across the room toward the windows... and stops at what she sees. Sitting on one of the tables is a GIFT BOX. Next to it is a small VASE filled with water. She puts the orchid in it, smiles at how much thought went into this. She looks around to see if the person responsible is nearby, then opens the box.
 It depicts a spectacular waterfall, cascading off a cliff.

 Commander Riker ENTERS to find Lieutenant Riker working at the pool table.
 where Troi and Beverly are talking while they do slow, controlled martial arts forms, dressed in their robes. Troi is animatedly recounting her evening with Lieutenant Riker.
 Where various N.D. Supernumeraries are enjoying themselves. Commander Riker is standing near the windows, gazing out at the stars.
 Where Commander Riker, Data and Worf are playing poker. Data has already folded and Worf now shows his hand with a confident air.

 Troi is alone, contemplating her situation. After a moment, the door CHIMES.

 Worf and Lieutenant Riker are at the center console; Commander Riker and Data are at a wall console.

 Riker clambers past the broken conduit and starts heading across the scaffolding... Lieutenant Riker follows a few steps behind.

 at impulse.
 DATA is at the controls. He hits a few controls.
 This is a NEW SET: A large room with a table, chairs, a couple of beds and a console. PICARD, GEORDI and TROI are seated around the table, finishing the remnants of a sparse lunch: a BOWL OF FRUIT, sandwiches, drinks, etc. The mood is fun, light. Data ENTERS and joins the conversation.
 at impulse.
 A few minutes later. Troi is on her feet, confused, trying to make sense out of what happened. Geordi scans Picard with a medical tricorder... then scans Troi. Data looks on.
 IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE, THE ENTIRE SCENE HAS CHANGED. Picard, Data and Geordi are now standing closely around Troi, looking at her with concern. Geordi is scanning her with a medical tricorder.
 Data at the controls. Picard and Troi join him.
 As it goes into WARP.
 A few minutes later. Data and Geordi at the helm. Picard and Troi look on. A small warning alarm goes off on the console.
 Picard ENTERS and moves to the console. He works for a moment... then something catches his eye. He glances at the table, reacts to what he sees. He walks up to the table, staring down at the bowl of fruit...
 The fruit is now completely ROTTEN -- shriveled and black.
 HIS FINGERNAILS HAVE GROWN A HALF INCH -- AS IF TIME HAS ELAPSED.

 the fruit has now completely DISINTEGRATED INTO DUST.
 Data continues his scan.
 Geordi sits and works the helm.
 It DISPLAYS a GRAPHIC of the Runabout in space. The ship is surrounded by dozens of irregular FRAGMENTS in space -- like glowing shards of glass.

 Later. Data and Geordi at the controls. Picard and Troi standing nearby. Geordi looks out the window, perplexed.
 as it slows to a stop in front of an incredible sight:
 As before -- face to face in mid-battle, completely motionless.
 Picard, Data, Geordi and Troi staring out the window, stunned by the sight.
 As before. Near the frozen Enterprise and Warbird.
 Later. Picard, Data and Troi are each wearing a Transporter armband on their arm. They each have a phaser and a tricorder strapped to their waist. Geordi is making the final adjustments to Picard's armband.
 As a FIELD FLASHES AROUND EACH OF THEM BRIEFLY. (NOTE: The fields should look skin-tight, like electrical
 Picard, Data and Troi MATERIALIZE in an open area. They look around the room -- it's a startling sight:
 EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE IS COMPLETELY STOPPED, FROZEN IN PLACE. The ship is utterly SILENT. The Bridge has been caught in mid-crisis. The ship is at Red Alert, consoles and warning lights stopped in mid-flash. The room is DAMAGED in a few places -- scorch marks on the walls, etc. N.D. CREWMEMBERS are present, all of them MOTIONLESS with looks of concern on their faces, some of them gripping consoles for support.

 take in the picture-still scene. Picard starts to move toward the Command Area, taking in all the details.
 is studying the console at Ops. He carefully reaches around the motionless crewmember and punches a few controls on the console. No response.
 Picard, Troi and Data are climbing downward (in that order) through the cramped space. On the move:
 as before -- frozen.
 ANGLE on the doors to the Jefferies Tube. Slowly, they start to OPEN... and we reveal that Data is prying them apart with android strength...
 Troi walking down the utterly silent hallway. She passes a FROZEN CREWMEMBER who has been caught in midstride. She eyes him as she passes... it's a disarming sight...
 Troi arrives at the entrance to Sickbay. TWO SECURITY GUARDS are stopped in the open doorway, phasers drawn, in the middle of ENTERING the room. Troi carefully brushes past them and enters the room...
 As Troi ENTERS and looks around. The room has been fixed in mid-moment. TWO MEDICAL N.D.S are visible frozen in mid-work. They have urgent expressions. Troi glances beside her. A frozen ROMULAN WOMAN is standing against the wall by the door. Troi walks further into the room... surveying the scene... and stops at what she sees:
 BEVERLY is standing a few feet away with her arms spread apart, body in mid-jolt, eyes wide with shock. A DISRUPTOR BLAST HAS PENETRATED HER CHEST -- THE GLOWING BEAM CAUGHT IN MID-FLASH. A nasty-looking HOLE has been burned through her chest.
 reacts. She takes a step toward Beverly, disturbed by the sight. It looks hopeless.
 A beat goes by. Then, inexplicably, the Romulan's eyes follow Troi as she exits. She turns toward the door. Clearly, she is not frozen in time.
 As before. Motionless.
 Picard walking along the empty hall. He passes a Turbolift whose doors are partially open... and something catches his eye. He moves to the doors... positions himself to get a good look inside the Turbolift...
 Just visible beyond to the half-closed door, a ROMULAN and an N.D. CREWMEMBER are standing side-by-side, motionless, apparently caught in mid-conversation.
 reacts to the sight, curious... then moves off down the corridor...
 The scene is FROZEN in a tableau. THREE ROMULANS are motionless on the Transporter stage. One is holding his arm, injured, a look of pain on his face. Another is helping him along. The third Romulan is stepping down off the Transporter platform, his mouth open in mid-speech. TWO SECURITY N.D.S are frozen at the foot of the stage, facing the Romulans, phasers drawn.

 ENTERS, looking shaken by her recent experience in Sickbay. She crosses to Picard.
 Data is studying the Pool Table read-outs. FOUR ENGINEERING N.D.S can been seen FROZEN in the room. One of them is working frantically; the other is running toward the door, a look of concern on his face.
 A CLOUD OF VIOLENT BLUE-WHITE GAS IS BALLOONING OUTWARD FROM THE CORE, FROZEN IN TIME. It is a warp core EXPLOSION, stopped at its beginning -- a strange and terrifying sight.
 standing near the breach cloud. He has just TRACED two eyes and a mouth in the gaseous cloud -- a big smiling face. He studies the result... then looks at Data and Troi. He points to the face and starts laughing again. Clearly, something is wrong with him.
 As before.
 Picard is sitting at the table. He has returned to normal, but looks exhausted. Geordi is studying an opened PANEL on one of the Transporter armbands. Data looks on.
 hanging motionless.
 (Similar to the Engineering room as seen in "The Next Phase.") Data, Geordi and Troi MATERIALIZE in a clear space in the room. They look around --
 EVERYTHING IS FROZEN. There are several ROMULAN N.D.S. stopped in various activities. There is a sense of urgency to their actions -- clearly, something urgent was happening when time stopped.
 take it all in.
 stop at a console. They study the screen.
 moves to a corner of the room and reads a console. (NOTE: This corner is empty -- there are no Romulans standing nearby). He reacts to the display.
 The core is filled with an otherworldly KALEIDOSCOPE -- AS IF SPACE ITSELF HAS BEEN FRAGMENTED, LIKE A SHATTERED MIRROR. IT IS CONTINUALLY SHIFTING, MOVING. (NOTE: Also visible within the kaleidoscope effect are several DARK SPOTS -- which we will later learn are ALIEN EGGS.)
 TIME RESUMES. THE ENTIRE SCENE COMES TO LIFE, CONTINUING ITS MOTION AND SOUND. Romulan N.D.s start working frantically, yelling out commands.
 as a distinctive-looking ROMULAN/ALIEN (MALE) rushes into the room, concerned. He stops at the sight of Data, Geordi and Troi. What are they doing here?
 Picard at the controls, concerned.
 as the ENTERPRISE EXPLODES from the warp core breach...
 The cabin FILLS with BRIGHT LIGHT from the explosion. Picard throws up his hands to shield his eyes --
 THE ENTERPRISE IS COMING BACK TOGETHER AGAIN. TIME IS REVERSING ITSELF.
 Everything we've just seen over the past few seconds -- Romulans working, voices, sounds, etc -- IS NOW MOVING BACKWARD, TIME REVERSING ITSELF.
 watch in utter amazement as EVERYTHING MOVES BACK INTO ITS ORIGINAL POSITION AND STOPS AT THE EXACT POINT WHERE TIME WAS ORIGINALLY FROZEN.
 A few minutes later. Data, Geordi and Troi talking to Picard on the com, mid-conversation.
 Picard at the controls.
 They glance around the room.

 As Troi removes the armband, GEORDI IS THROWN INTO FROZEN TIME. He STOPS in mid-convulsion, a look of agony caught on his face.

 As before.
 Later. Picard, Data and Troi standing by one of the beds. Lying on the bed is the Romulan who attacked Geordi. He's unconscious.
 as he glances around, disoriented. He tries to sit up but reacts to a pain in his head, dizzy. He falls back down... looks up at the others with fear and confusion. He tries to speak -- his VOICE is ALIEN, halting, jerky, strange. Clearly, he is not a Romulan.
 As before.
 Minutes later. Data is working the console. Picard and Troi pacing the room, tense.
 As before -- facing the frozen Enterprise and Warbird.
 The scene frozen, as before -- except now, the GASEOUS CLOUD OF THE CORE BREACH EXPLOSION IS LARGER.
 standing at a console, holding a small PADD-like device. He taps his Transporter armband.
 Everything frozen. Picard at the aft science station, standing ready.
 Troi standing a few feet away from Beverly, who is still frozen in mid-death. She positions herself near Beverly, phaser drawn, ready. (NOTE: The Romulan Woman by the door -- who was seen watching Troi in Act Two -- is no longer present).
 Data as before.
 A TRICORDER has been placed on the floor facing the engine core. It is BLINKING. A moment later, the core SENDS OUT a FLASH OF LIGHT...
 Picard waiting, looking around him...
 Suddenly, EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE STARTS TO MOVE BACKWARDS -- TIME RUNNING IN REVERSE. All of the sounds and motions begin to move backwards. (NOTE: The action here is the exact reverse of the forward action in scene 94).
 ON BEVERLY AS THE ROMULAN DISRUPTOR BLAST REVERSES DIRECTION AND GOES BACK INTO THE WEAPON.
 Data standing ready at the console. The gaseous cloud of the warp core breach is now gone. N.D.S can be seen in the background, WORKING BACKWARDS. Data speaks over the strange NOISE of sounds running backwards.
 seen in Act Two. She is walking forward through the room, clearly unaffected by the time reversal.
 senses her and spins around -- too late. The Romulan Woman comes at him -- speaks in the same ALIEN VOICE heard earlier.
 as they slowly COME TO A STOP, THEN START MOVING FORWARD -- TIME HAS RESUMED ITS NORMAL COURSE. One of the N.D.s starts to operate the console where Data was standing ready.
 gets to his feet, a little dazed. The Romulan woman remains unconscious. A beat, then Data quickly moves to the N.D. at the console.
 TIME MOVING FORWARD. We see the following action happen quickly:
 Troi KNOCKS Beverly aside just as the DISRUPTOR BLAST shoots by Beverly and HITS the wall. The Romulan takes a step toward Beverly, but Troi immediately aims her phaser at him.
 Data has moved to another console.
 As before. Picard and Riker, urgent.
 The Runabout FLIES into the space between the Enterprise and the Romulan ship, INTERRUPTING the TRANSFER BEAM. The Runabout EXPLODES.
 Data at the console. A few feet away, the unconscious Romulan VANISHES IN A KALEIDOSCOPE EFFECT. Data reacts.
 Picard reading tactical.
 The alien who attacked me has vanished, sir.
 Riker looks at Picard, puzzled.
 at impulse.
 A couple of days later. Data is sitting at a table, staring intently at a small TEA KETTLE, which is on a burner.
 Seated around the poker table clockwise are DATA, STEPHEN HAWKING, ALBERT EINSTEIN, and ISAAC NEWTON. Everyone has chips and cards in front of them -- a small device is holding Hawking's cards for him. Hawking is telling the last few lines of a very esoteric joke.
 he has four SEVENS.
 As they all react. Einstein's shoulders slump in defeat.
 The ship at warp.
 PICARD ENTERS from the aft Turbolift and moves toward RIKER, who is standing at one of the aft science stations. WORF and TROI are at their stations, an N.D. at Conn. Data ENTERS from the forward Turbolift and moves to Ops. The ship is on Red Alert.
 The screen shows an ALIEN VESSEL in orbit around a planet. The ship is unlike any other we've ever seen. It has very little markings or decoration, but it is clearly menacing.
 A typical Federation science station which has recently been attacked. There are DEAD BODIES everywhere, and a few scorch marks are visible on the walls, but the physical damage is actually minimal. Riker, Data, Worf, and ONE N.D. SECURITY GUARD MATERIALIZE. Everyone is wearing phasers, and Data and Worf have tricorders.
 The door suddenly OPENS and reveals a BORG STANDING IN THE DOORWAY.
 Riker, Data, and the Security Guard react with shock, but before they can do anything, another BORG ENTERS the room and FIRES at them. Riker and Data dive for cover just as SEVERAL OTHER BORG start to rush in, FIRING their weapons.
 The Alien ship suddenly FIRES on the Enterprise.
 Picard and Geordi are on the Bridge. The ship ROCKS with the impact.
 Riker and Data have taken cover behind some consoles and they are trading PHASER SHOTS with the Borg. These Borg are not acting like the calm, neutral automatons that we've become used to seeing. They are quickfooted, cunning, and ferocious. Their faces are twisted into expressions of fury and hatred... and they take care to hide behind objects to avoid being shot -- in short, they are behaving like individuals instead of mindless worker ants.
 BORG #2 peeks out from behind a console to get a better look at the Starfleet officers. He looks at each of them in turn as if going over some unseen checklist.
 Jumps up to take on Borg #3 as he rushes at them. Data and the Borg begin a fierce hand to hand fight...
 Continue to trade phaser FIRE with the other Borg.
 Suddenly a change happens during Data's fight with the Borg... the expression on his normally neutral face begins to harden... his features twist into a snarl... and without warning, he suddenly PICKS UP the Borg and snarls into his face, his voice loud with rage and anger...
 As all the Borg suddenly break off their attack. They take a step back and then DEMATERIALIZE. Riker and Worf look at each other for a moment... then pick themselves up off the ground and look at Data with shock. Data looks confused... the rage and violence we saw only a moment ago is now gone and he seems puzzled by what's happened.
 Geordi reacts to something on his console.
 The ship is moving at impulse... suddenly a BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT APPEARS in front of the ship. The Alien vessel abruptly VANISHES. Once the ship is gone, the Light also disappears.
 As before. The Viewscreen shows only an empty starfield. Picard stares at the screen and frowns in frustration.
 As before. Riker moves over to Data, who still looks shocked.
 The ship in orbit around Ohniaka Three.
 Picard, Riker, Worf, Troi, and BEVERLY are seated around the table.
 Geordi is checking out Data with a tricorder. He shakes his head after a beat and closes the tricorder.
 The Enterprise and the STARSHIP GORKON are running side by side.
 Picard and ADMIRAL NECHAYEV (from "Chain of Command") are talking.
 The Gorkon pulls away at impulse.
 Troi and Data are sitting in the office.
 The ship is moving at impulse power.
 Riker in Command, Worf at Tactical. Riker is just turning away from Worf.
 The ship at warp.
 Picard is sitting at his desk, looking at his monitor. We see that he is watching a visual recording of HUGH from "I, Borg." Specifically, this clip is Scene 27R, Picard watches the scene for a few beats (not more than ten seconds), remembering his own encounter with Hugh. When the scene reaches the point where Hugh says "We are Hugh," the door to the Ready Room CHIMES and Picard touches a control which FREEZES the image of Hugh's face on the screen.
 Geordi is walking down the Corridor toward the Holodeck. He reaches the doors and presses the panel. The doors OPEN and he ENTERS.
 The Holodeck has recreated the destroyed Outpost as seen in Act One. Data is FIGHTING a Holo-Borg in the same manner as seen earlier.
 Data moves back to his previous position. The Holo-Borg is now standing at the ready again.
 Racing along at warp.
 Picard and Riker at the aft science station, with Worf at Tactical.
 The alien Borg ship seen earlier is heading away from the Enterprise.
 The ship is PULLED INSIDE and then the distortion finally VANISHES, leaving no trace of the Enterprise.
 As before. The ship is shaking violently. An INTENSE FLICKERING LIGHT from the Viewscreen casts a bright glow on the Bridge crew.
 The Borg ship is now getting closer.
 returns FIRE at a Borg, killing him.
 FIRES at a Borg and misses. The Borg FIRES back and the Officer is killed.
 FIRES at that Borg -- who is named CROSIS -- and he goes down.
 As everyone recovers from the attack. Riker checks on the downed officer... then shakes his head.
 Data and Picard are standing outside the Brig along with An N.D. BAJORAN SECURITY GUARD. They are all watching Beverly and Worf, who are inside the Brig. The unconscious Borg is on a bed inside the cell and Beverly is treating him. Worf's phaser is at the ready. Beverly finishes and then turns to Picard.
 Data's cat, SPOT, is sitting on the desk. Data reaches down to pet his cat.
 The cat suddenly HISSES and SPITS in response to Data. The cat immediately runs away.
 Who thinks about this for a moment... and then he seems pleased with this reaction.
 The ship hangs in space.
 Picard, Riker and Geordi are at the aft science station. Geordi is indicating an OKUDAGRAM graphic showing several segments of a "pipe" through space. Worf is at Tactical.
 The small two-man shuttle is moving through space. Suddenly the distortion begins flashing in front of it and the shuttle goes inside. The distortion then DISAPPEARS.
 As before. The crew stares at the Viewscreen, amazed by this turn of events.
 As before.
 The ship ENTERS the Distortion and then disappears.
 As before. The ship is SHAKING. The intense light comes from the Viewscreen.
 The ship is entering orbit.
 Picard, Geordi, and Riker are at the aft station. Riker points to an Okudagram of the planet on the screen.
 The abandoned shuttlecraft is sitting in the middle of a wide open expanse of green rolling hills with a great deal of vegetation in evidence. Riker, Worf, and FOUR N.D. SECURITY GUARDS MATERIALIZE on the surface. They are all facing outward in a defensive circle and they all have their phasers drawn. After a beat, they relax a little. Worf pulls out his tricorder and tries to scan the area.
 As Picard listens to the report of the Away Team.
 Any last orders?
 Revealing Beverly talking to Picard on the Bridge several hours later. The other positions are filled by N.D. CREWMEMBERS. Picard is wearing a phaser.
 Riker and Worf have set up a small table with a console near the shuttlecraft. Several other N.D. Officers (in groups of four) are heading off in different directions and Two N.D. Engineering Officers wait by the shuttle.
 A few hours have passed and Picard's team stops for a break. They're all pretty tired.
 Through the brush, they can just make out the top of some kind of structure in the distance.
 Come on.
 The Away Team climbs a hill toward a Large Alien Building. Picard pulls his phaser and the Away Team approaches cautiously. Geordi begins scanning with his tricorder.
 The Hall is an immense open space, like a concert hall without the chairs. A platform dominates one end and there are doors and corridors suggesting other rooms. The entire hall is dark and foreboding, but a couple of lights pierce the gloom.
 They begin to run for the door, but it's too late. MANY BORG come SCREAMING into the room from the doorways and corridors. It's like an attack of banshees and the Away Team has no chance to escape.
 The Borg stop instantly and the Away Team looks up to see what they think is Data standing on the platform in the room. He is wearing what could be a military uniform.
 Revealing Data as he comes through the crowd. He is still wearing his Starfleet uniform, but his entire demeanor and bearing have changed... he now seems malevolent, dangerous... evil.
 as it orbits the planet.
 Since we have only the skeleton crew the Bridge is slightly undermanned. BEVERLY stands at an Aft Station studying the sensors. There is a young woman, TAITT, at Tactical.
 RIKER, WORF and two N.D.s.
 In the b.g. we see two N.D. 's of his team, and another team more at a distance.
 SALAZAR, a young NCO, is at the controls. We can see several Away Teams stepping off the Transporter pad.
 The Borg ship is bearing down in the distance.
 The Borg ship fires at the Enterprise. The Enterprise is rocked by the blast.
 as it flashes away.
 The Borg aren't following us, sir.
 Where we see more Away Teams stepping off the Pad and filing out the door.
 Beverly is not happy about this. Her frustration shows.
 Riker and Worf are now alone, the two N.D.s having been evacuated. The planet's surface suddenly seems that much more vast and desolate.
 LORE is moving through the crowd of Borg that still surround PICARD, TROI, and GEORDI. DATA is nearby, as is CROSIS.
 Riker and Worf come to a stop on a ridge that is covered by scrub-like vegetation. Worf scans with his TRICORDER.
 Data and the Borg Guard are marching the prisoners into a brig-like holding cell. Picard and the others have obviously been working on Data, trying to assess what's happened to him, trying to find a way to reach him.
 as it drops out of warp.
 Various N.D. 's are ENTERING the Bridge by the Turbolift, taking up positions to fully man the stations. Beverly is in the Command Chair, unhappy about having to leave crew behind.
 One minute should do it.
 Lore is talking with an N.D. Borg. Other Borg move around the hall going about their various tasks. When Lore sees Data ENTER the hall he sends the N.D. Borg away and calls out to him:
 Picard, Troi and the VISOR-less Geordi in midconversation.
 Riker and Worf are making their way up a fairly steep hill. It is rough going. Suddenly Worf reacts to something off to the side, and quickly shoves Riker and himself into the cover of nearby bushes.
 walking by as Riker and Worf crouch in silence. The feet march on.
 Worf peers out from under the brush, is satisfied the Borg are gone, and gestures Riker out. The two stand, brushing themselves off.
 seen from a distance.
 Suddenly, they hear footsteps and muffled voices off to one side. Quickly, they move the opposite direction, toward some brush (trees, etc.). They move through the brush, seeking cover -- when suddenly they run right into three Borg holding their weapons trained on them.
 Riker and Worf are being led along a rock-lined passageway by the three Borg. There are CARGO CONTAINERS and other signs that this place is lived in.
 Riker, Worf, and Hugh have moved to another part of the chamber and are talking. Hugh has explained Lore's takeover of the Borg, and his take on it does not sit right with Worf.
 A small chamber with alien scientific equipment.
 A BORG is standing silently at his post, just down the corridor from the cell where our people are being held.
 as it warps toward the planet.
 There is an air of urgency in the room. Beverly is at an Aft Station with Barnaby. They're looking at an OKUDAGRAM that shows the planet.
 A group of N.D. officers are stepping off the Transporter pad.
 Keep trying.

 Shields are down to eighty percent.

 Beverly is at the rear stations with Barnaby and Taitt. The next is at an urgent pace; they need an answer quickly.
 as it disappears from view inside the sun's glare -- moments later the Borg ship pulls up and away from the sun.
 The Borg ship has broken off pursuit.
 Geordi has been taken away again, and Picard is modifying the (TECH) component he took from the Borg. Troi is standing so as to block what he's doing should anyone look inside the cell.
 Data is scanning Geordi with a MEDICAL DEVICE.
 Hugh, Riker and Worf have returned to the main chamber from their reconnaissance. Riker and Worf are laying out their rescue plan. Hugh stands to one side, listening.
 Data approaches Lore, who is seated, surveying the landscape from just outside an entrance to the compound. Borg workers come and go as they perform their various tasks.
 as Lore flips the nail up, revealing circuitry inside.
 Perhaps I should cut back a little...
 The Enterprise hangs in space inside the sun's corona.
 Light from the sun's corona reflects on the Bridge crew. Barnaby and Taitt are at an Aft Station. Taitt is working a console, concentrating intently on something.

 She did it. The Borg ship has been destroyed.
 The SOUND of the force field deactivating causes them to look toward the cell opening, where Data appears.
 Picard and Data ENTER the empty room in midconversation.
 Troi is tending Geordi when her attention is caught by the SOUND of a phaser blast coming from the corridor outside the cell. Having no way of knowing what this portends, she listens with some concern to the SOUND of hurriedly approaching footsteps. To her relief, Riker and Worf appear at the cell door moments later.
 Lore has approached Picard and Data. Crosis and the other Borg stand along the periphery of the room, watching silently.
 Looking on approvingly.

 For a long moment, Data's decision hangs in the air. Finally:
 Revealing that one of the Borg standing behind Lore is Hugh.

 As Lore speaks, he surreptitiously opens his fingernail.

 The fight is over. Riker approaches Worf and Picard.
 as it moves at warp.
 Data is sitting at his desk, petting SPOT, looking at a MICRO-CHIP on a glass slide. The door CHIMES.
 CLOSE ON WORF'S FACE. He looks disgusted. Off camera, his hands are working furiously at something... and he grows more and more agitated by whatever he's doing...
 Worf standing in front of a mirror. He is wearing a Starfleet DRESS UNIFORM -- a thigh-level tunic with pants underneath. He is attempting to tie an ornate SASH around his chest, but it isn't easy. He steps back and takes a look -- it's crooked and sloppy. Frustrated, he undoes the sash and starts tying it again. He just can't get it right...
 An ALIEN SHUTTLECRAFT sits in the bay. PICARD and TROI (Picard in his jacket, carrying a duffel bag; Troi in dress uniform;) are facing the shuttle. Riker and Worf are also present. Clearly, this is a very important moment for all of them. Except for Worf, who looks distinctly uncomfortable.
 as the diplomatic pleasantries continue. He is bored stiff...

 The reception is in progress. Riker, Worf, Troi and DATA are there with several other Starfleet Officers. (They are still in their dress uniforms.) A large BUFFET TABLE has been set-up -- it's topped with various FOOD and DRINKS.
 moving along the buffet table. Troi holds an empty plate; Loquel also holds a plate, but his is piled high with food. As they talk, he keeps putting more food onto his plate.
 sitting at a table. They all have food in front of them. Byleth takes a bite of his food, reacts with disgust. He shoves his plate of food toward Worf.
 The shuttle seen in the Teaser, at impulse.
 The Pilot (Voval) seen earlier is at the controls. (There's a small INSIGNIA PIN on the Pilot's uniform at the sternum. It should not call attention to itself in any way.) Picard is sitting next to him, trying his best to strike up a conversation with the man. It isn't easy. The Pilot is unresponsive, apparently uninterested in anything Picard has to say.
 as a distant planet comes into view.
 As before, trembling.
 The shuttlecraft SPIRALS down through the planet's atmosphere... and disappears from sight...
 A rocky, inhospitable surface. It's windy, and large spider-like formations of PLASMA LIGHTNING can be seen arcing up from the ground in the distance, lighting up the darkened sky.
 The alien shuttlecraft lies wrecked on the surface.
 It's dark. Smoke hangs in the air. Emergency lights are flickering weakly. The light from the distant plasma lightning FLASHES through the windows. The Pilot is slumped over the controls, semi-conscious, a nasty-looking WOUND on his forehead.
 lying on the floor, disoriented. He sits up, grabs hold of a console and pulls himself to his feet... looks around the shuttle, spots the Pilot, moves to him.
 A distinctive panel with several diamond-shaped controls on it (NOTE: It is undamaged and functioning). Picard hits a few buttons.
 Picard walks outside, bracing himself against the wind. Somewhere offscreen, plasma lightning is FLASHING. He scans the region with his tricorder, then begins to make his way across the rocky terrain with great difficulty...
 Picard trying to move quickly. Offscreen, A BRIGHT FLASH of plasma lightning causes him to stop and hang back. After a beat, he presses on. The wind is howling...

 Worf is lying in bed, fast asleep. After a moment, the door CHIMES. Worf stirs slightly. The door CHIMES again and Worf wakes up. He straggles out of bed, groggy, crosses to the door and touches a control. The door slides open to reveal --
 Troi and Ambassador Loquel are walking along, mid-conversation. Loquel is carrying a elaborate-looking cup of orange-colored liquid with a straw sticking out of it -- it looks like the 24th century equivalent of a "Big Gulp." Throughout the scene, he takes little sips of it.
 A MOTHER and her SON (a six year-old boy) walk past a nearby intersection...

 Troi rounds the corner and stops at what she sees --
 who is kneeling before the young boy, holding him with both hands at arm's length. He turns the boy from side to side, staring at him with intense curiosity, as if he's never seen a child before. The boy is staring back at him with a startled expression on his face.
 CLOSE ON Picard, who is lying on his side on a small make-shift cot... unconscious. The room is dimly-lit. Gradually, Picard wakes up... groggy and disoriented... tries to sit but is too weak... He looks around...
 It's a long, tunnel-like room, with a single door along one side. A few half-charred consoles can be seen... and several cargo containers, which are nothing more than shapes in the dim light. The room is CANTED slightly, as if it's been in a crash.

 As one of the dark shapes slowly begins to move, rising from where it was sitting in a chair. Clearly, it is a person -- and it is moving toward Picard. Picard watches with growing concern as the person moves closer... almost menacing. He tries to sit up...
 as her face moves into the light. She is human, midthirties... a very pretty woman whose face has seen many years of pain. Her skin is very pale... her clothes torn in a few places, ragged. She wears a distinctive-looking NECKLACE with a pendant around her neck.
 The ship lies wrecked on the surface.
 A few hours later. CLOSE ON Picard asleep, lying on the cot. He wakes with a start, alarmed, and glances around the room... then finally remembers where he is...
 at impulse.
 Worf and Byleth are walking through the room, Worf showing him around. GEORDI is working in the background, as well as a couple of Engineering N.D.s. Worf is trying his best to be polite. He indicates the large back-wall graphic of the Enterprise.
 Worf, Riker and Troi. Worf is on his feet, fuming.
 The crashed cargo freighter, as seen before.
 It's hours later. Picard is lying on the cot, alone. The fire is still burning. A quiet moment passes... then Picard reaches for the cup of water -- it's empty. He glances across the room, sees a large jug of water sitting on the floor. He decides to get up...
 The rear of the com panel is CHARRED with SCORCH MARKS, heavily damaged.
 Anna looks worried.
 The crashed cargo freighter, as seen before.
 It's a few hours later. Picard is standing on top of a cargo container, working at an OPENED PANEL on the wall. He's trying to dismantle a COMPONENT (A POWER CELL) from its position in the circuitry.
 Riker, Loquel, Troi, Worf and Byleth are sitting around a table in that order, playing five card draw. The Ambassadors are clearly new at the game. Loquel is eating from a small plate of chocolate candy, which he keeps nibbling on during the scene.
 The crashed cargo freighter.
 A while later. Picard is working on the power cell, which is still humming and glowing. Anna sits nearby, quietly watching him...
 the shuttle pilot -- he's alive and well.
 Continuous action. Picard and the Pilot looking at one another in surprise. (NOTE: The small insignia pin seen earlier on the Pilot's sternum is now gone -- this is a subtlety that neither we nor Picard should notice.)
 A short time later. Picard and the Pilot stop at a LEDGE that overlooks a bottomless CHASM. The Pilot looks into the darkness below with concern.
 Picard walking... searching... calling out...
 Visible in the distance, standing near the edge of the cliff -- is Anna. She's staring down into the chasm.
 ON ANNA'S NECKLACE, which is now back around her neck.
 He knows something is definitely wrong here. His expression hardens.

 The Iyaaran shuttlecraft is sitting in the bay with its doors open. Picard and Voval are getting out -- Picard in his jacket, carrying his duffel bag. They have just returned.

 standing at the shuttle, face-to-face.
 as Voval, Loquel and Byleth bow ceremoniously. Picard joins Riker, Worf and Troi, and they all bow in return. It's a warm moment.
 GEORDI is rushing up a ladder in the tube. The RED ALERT CLAXON is sounding around him -- this is clearly an emergency. He is wearing his Starfleet uniform, but not his VISOR; his eyes are not clouded and his temple inputs aren't in place.
 Close on Riker's face as he reacts with concern to Geordi's cough.
 Geordi stops coughing, continues climbing.
 It's under control.
 Geordi goes to start down the tube ladder, but he has trouble placing his foot on the lower rung.
 Geordi's left thigh appears to be twitching slightly.
 Geordi successfully plants his left foot in the ladder rung and starts down the tube.
 Riker is eyeing the apparatus.
 as Geordi leaves the Jefferies tube and crosses past the pool table, he sees something offscreen that startles him.
 Geordi has the same startled look on his face.
 Geordi is looking at "his" reflection in a glass panel -- only it's not him looking back. He sees THE PROBE -- a two-foot long metallic CYLINDER. Tiny force beams -- like pencil-thin needles of light -- project constantly from its surface, sweeping over everything around it.
 In orbit above a huge, greenish, Neptune-like planet. The swirling, violent quality of its atmosphere can be seen even from here.
 Worf and the CON officer are at their posts.

 as he crosses the Bridge and goes into the Ready Room.
 Picard steps around to the monitor on his desk.
 Geordi is fiddling with the interface console as Data is applying a pen-like instrument to the interface unit, checking everything out.
 Geordi is watching a message on the monitor from CAPTAIN SILVA LA FORGE, Geordi's mother. She is dressed in a red Starfleet uniform.
 Worf is at tactical, Riker is at aft science, Picard is in his seat, and various N.D.s are at other posts. Riker turns from his console.
 Geordi is wearing the interface helmet; Data is adjusting it and Beverly is working at a nearby monitor.
 He answers as if from far away.
 Everything is dark, murky.
 Geordi's face suddenly becomes animated.
 As before in Black & White. Suddenly, the scene becomes COLORED, and we can see the glare from the Red Alert.
 standing in the corridor, looking around (the same convention we used when he was using the probe to fight the fire in the Teaser).
 Beverly is watching the monitor.
 Or a first date... Everything's okay.
 Data looks over to Beverly to see if he should comply with Geordi's request. She checks Geordi's vital signs for a beat, then nods a cautious go ahead.
 Suddenly, Geordi's hands move strongly upwards, removing the fallen material and casting it aside. He bends down to investigate the crew member.
 And again -- Geordi cries out in pain.
 In orbit above the huge, greenish planet.
 Geordi has both hands inside a small clear BOX that is bathing his burns in a blue light. His wounds are partially healed and he's still wearing the interface suit. Picard and Beverly are standing around him.
 Riker is at the station.
 As before.
 Geordi is watching his father, DOCTOR LA FORGE, on the small monitor. Doctor La Forge is wearing science blue, and has three pips on his collar.
 Data is staring at a blank computer screen. The door CHIMES.
 In orbit above Marijne Seven.
 Beverly is checking over the interface unit on Geordi's head as Data works with the console.
 Everything is dark.
 Data works the controls.
 Geordi is standing in the room, staring straight ahead, with a dumbfounded look on his face.
 standing directly in front of Geordi, facing him.
 Geordi is staring at his mother standing in front of him.
 Data and Beverly react to Geordi as he says the words.
 Silva La Forge stares at him for a moment -- there's a confused look on her face.
 The safety cut-off has disengaged the interface but the overload has caused Geordi to lose consciousness.
 Geordi is now sitting on the big diagnostic bed, as Beverly runs various scans on him. He's wearing the interface suit and his VISOR and seems a little shaken up. Picard and Data are standing by.
 Troi is seated in a chair, watching as Geordi (now in uniform) paces slowly in front of her. He's impatient -- he doesn't want to be here.
 Picard, Riker and Geordi. Data is presenting his report; Geordi looks impatient.
 As all its readouts and monitors light up.

 The ship in orbit above Marijne Seven.
 Geordi as probe is standing inside Auxiliary Control. He glances around the room -- he is alone.
 standing nearby, where Geordi was looking only a moment before.
 Data is carefully watching Geordi's reactions.
 We need your help.
 Geordi, the atmosphere becomes increasingly turbulent the farther down you go -- you may not be able to bring the Raman close enough to the Hera before being destroyed.
 We're running out of time.
 Eventually, yeah.
 I'm losing the interface.
 As he looks around:
 When we are ready to disconnect the interface, we must allow sufficient time to lower the input levels -- otherwise your nervous system would go into shock from the sudden drop in input.
 As Geordi works the console.
 Picard, Riker, Worf, the CON officer. Worf reacts to his console.
 Data is studying a readout with concern.
 Silva reacts with alarm to Data's words.
 You are putting me in a very difficult position. Please cease your descent.
 Geordi continues to work the Raman's console, as his mother looks on.
 Picard and Beverly are now with Data. Picard is facing Geordi.
 If I come back now, my mother and her entire crew will die. I'm scanning for your ship... I'm not getting anything.

 Geordi's face is contorting with pain. An energy pulse is crackling around his VISOR inputs.
 Silva La Forge continues to hold the sides of Geordi's head -- his agony appears to increase.
 The energy arcs have stopped.
 Geordi is working the console. Silva is standing in the background, as if waiting. Picard's voice is barely audible.
 Everyone reacts to Geordi's report.
 I'll turn the ship around and come back as soon as we're --
 Beverly continues to work as fast as she can.
 Geordi at the controls.
 As Geordi continues the same cry, Beverly hits a control on the interface console.
 The ship is at impulse across a field of stars.
 Picard is behind his desk, Geordi standing somewhat formally in front of him -- he's been called on the carpet.
 as it moves slowly away...
 It's a rough, wretched watering-hole, just the kind of place you'd expect on a frontier world at the edge of Federation space. The patrons are a hard and nasty bunch -- if you're looking for trouble, this is a good place to find it.

 He wouldn't admit to having seen the Captain... but he said that anyone who visited the ruins of Nafir would probably come here eventually... I suspect he knows more.

 Beverly is staring at an OKUDAGRAM of a DNA sequence displayed on the wall monitor. Riker ENTERS and crosses to her.
 Riker is working at his desk when door CHIMES.
 Riker is in the Captain's chair; Worf is at tactical. Various N.D.s in the b.g. ENSIGN GIUSTI is at Ops.
 As Riker ENTERS, he stops; he stares at Picard's empty desk for a brief moment, feeling everything it represents... and then, decisively, he moves and sits down -- there will be time to remember later.
 Riker ENTERS to find Yranac sitting at a table surrounded by a huge assortment of food, eating heartily. Riker is carrying a PADD.

 Riker, Geordi, Worf, and two Security Officers, N.D. #1 and N.D. #2, are in a large clearing. The forest has encroached on a variety of simple ruins; however, in several places through the site, there are strange INDENTATIONS in the ground: smooth, circularly-shaped holes which almost suggest that something was scooped away.

 Worf is standing near the edge of the clearing with N.D. #1. Riker and Geordi move to join them.
 The phaser fire came from the trees ahead of the Away Team; as the action plays out, we will see the attackers. They are a team of THREE ARMED MERCENARIES: the leader, a Romulan female, TALLERA; a large, intimidating alien female, VEKOR; and an alien male, NARIK.

 Geordi, Worf, and N.D. #2 are at the spot where Riker and the mercenaries dematerialized seconds before.
 Data and Giusti as before.

 coming out of warp.
 Tallera (the Romulan female we saw earlier) is leading a groggy Riker across the room as he struggles painfully back to consciousness. Riker's combadge is gone and there is now a small patch-like device (like all the other mercenaries wear) at the side of his throat.
 As he turns around from one of the consoles to face the others. He's dressed like one of the mercenaries.
 Riker is completely stunned at the sight of Picard, but he quickly controls himself -- before he says anything, he has to figure out what's going on here.

 Riker is alone and thoroughly agitated -- he's got plenty of questions and no answers. Suddenly, the DOOR OPENS and Picard ENTERS.
 Baran is standing on the central platform briefing the crew. Picard, Vekor, Narik, and Tallera and other N.D. Mercenaries are gathered around.
 The room looks like a cross between an archaeological museum and a science lab. The walls are jammed with scientific consoles, and the remaining spaces are filled with artifacts scattered around the room in and out of cargo containers.

 Picard, Tallera, Narik, and Vekor are in the b.g. at various stations. Riker is talking to a Starfleet Officer, LIEUTENANT SANDERS, on a monitor at one of the consoles. Baran stands nearby, out of view of the screen, watching Riker carefully.

 as several artifacts MATERIALIZE on the Transporter pad.
 There should be at least two more pieces down there.
 Data is at command and Troi is at her station; Worf is at tactical and Giusti at ops.
 Baran instantly accuses Riker.
 Riker appears on the Viewscreen. Reactions all around.
 Tell them!
 I've never explained my orders to you before and I'm not going to start now.
 Everyone is still mystified by Riker's behavior.
 Riker, Picard, Baran, and Tallera are gathered around a console.
 The Mercenary ship opens fire on the helpless Enterprise, scoring a direct hit on the warp nacelles.
 As seen at the end of Part I -- DATA, TROI, WORF, and GIUSTI in their places. The ship is ROCKED SLIGHTLY by the blast from the Mercenary ship.
 The Enterprise FIRES on the Mercenary vessel.
 The ship is ROCKED. (PICARD, RIKER, BARAN, TALLERA, NARIK, and VEKOR as seen at the end of Part I.)
 As before.
 The Mercenary ship leaves the "crippled" Enterprise and races away.
 The ship hangs in space.
 Worf at Tactical, Troi and GEORDI at the aft science stations, Giusti at Ops. Data moves from station to station, and people automatically report to him as he approaches.
 On the monitor in front of Troi is a video replay of Riker's last Viewscreen transmission from Part I. Troi FREEZES the image as Data approaches.
 The ship comes to a STOP near a large planet.
 Baran in command. Picard, Riker, Tallera, Vekor, and Narik at their stations.
 Looks from Baran to Riker... thinks for a few beats, then EXITS.
 Picard is checking over a group of NEW ARTIFACTS (a few pieces of exotic pottery, ancient weapons, tools, etc.) on the scanner pad. Picard makes a note on a PADD and takes a relic off the scanner. He begins to examine another relic. The doors OPEN and Tallera ENTERS. Picard doesn't look up.
 In contrast to the other quarters on the mercenary ship, Baran's quarters border on the luxurious... overstuffed furniture, gaudy sculpture -- very decadent. Baran is lounging in a chair while Riker sits on a couch... Baran holds a drink.
 Data is sitting at the aft science station as Worf and Geordi look on. Giusti at Ops. The monitor screen shows an OKUDAGRAM image of a sequence of numbers and letters which have been arranged into some kind of pattern.
 Data and Worf ENTER. Once the doors close, Data turns around and confronts Worf without preamble.
 The ship hangs in space.
 Baran and Riker are standing over Narik, who is working at his engineering console. Vekor is working at a console in the b.g.
 A small, cramped room with only the barest of accommodations. Picard is looking over a PADD when the door suddenly OPENS. Picard whirls instinctively and whips out a phaser. Riker freezes in the open doorway for a moment, then Picard motions him inside.
 Picard is talking to Narik, who has taken one of the panels off the wall and is working on some complex circuitry within using a device. Mid-conversation.
 As before.
 The ship drops out of warp.
 Data, Troi, and Worf in Command, Giusti at Ops, an N.D. Crewmember at Tactical.
 The screen comes on and shows KORAL -- a large Klingon with a brooding look and ill-disposition.
 A short time later. The KLINGON SHUTTLE has now been brought into the bay. Worf and BEVERLY approach the shuttle door and wait. The door to the shuttle OPENS and Koral begins to step out...
 as she looks up... and up... and up...
 Revealing Koral as he stands before Beverly -- he may be the tallest Klingon we've ever seen. He stands there towering above Beverly like some kind of displeased skyscraper. She is a little taken aback, but then steadies herself.
 Baran is standing in command when Vekor suddenly sees something on her console. Picard is at the weapons console and Riker is in the b.g.
 The ship hangs in space.
 Data and Troi are trying to get Koral engaged in conversation, but aren't having much luck. Data is pouring them drinks from a pitcher of liquid.
 Beverly and Worf are standing outside the Klingon shuttle. Beverly closes her tricorder in frustration.
 Data, Troi, and Koral as seen before.
 Baran in command, Tallera, and Vekor at their stations.
 Continuous from Act Four. Baran presses the button on the control device and then suddenly Baran grabs his own neck in pain and drops to the floor, dead -- a stunned look on his face. Everyone is shocked except Picard, who moves to Baran's body and takes the control device out of his limp hand. Tallera moves to him.
 at impulse.
 Riker working on a PADD.
 Picard and Tallera are at the computer console which has a great deal of text information on the screen. The two pieces of the resonator are sitting on a nearby table.
 Picard picks up the two pieces together and runs his fingers over the intricate inscriptions.
 As before. Picard turns the large piece over and shows Tallera the bottom of the base piece.
 The bottom of the base has TWO large SYMBOLS -- one an intricate series of circles and lines, the other a more abstract drawing of heroic Vulcan figure. There is a large NOTCH missing from the base at the point where the third piece is supposed to fit into it. PART of a jagged LINE borders the area of the missing piece -- it's incomplete, suggesting yet another symbol on the other piece.
 Picard indicates the point where the missing piece would fit.
 The Mercenary ship enters orbit around the planet Vulcan.
 Picard in command, Tallera, Vekor, and Narik at their stations.
 This used to be a hideaway for Vulcan soldiers over two thousand years ago -- think of the catacombs where Christians used to hide from the Romans. The cavern itself is dark and gloomy, and there are remnants of decaying Vulcan artifacts lying around... some cracked and peeling glyphs on the walls... a very old and dusty place. A crude stone altar dominates the room. In front of the altar is a modern storage CONTAINER.
 as he reacts to something with puzzlement...
 The underside of the third piece has a unique Vulcan symbol on it. As Tallera assembles the resonator, this symbol falls neatly into place with the other two symbols we have seen earlier.
 as Vekor OPENS the storage container and examines the bars of gold-pressed latinum within.
 As a DISTORTION suddenly appears in the air in front of him... he gives it a puzzled look for a moment, and then a LOUD CRACKLE of energy BLOWS him backwards across the cavern as if by an unseen hand... he falls to the floor, dead.
 Reacts to Narik's death and points her phaser at Tallera, but she's too late -- the DISTORTION appears in front of her and then Vekor is also killed.
 As Picard faces Tallera alone in the silent cavern. His eyes automatically drop to one of the phasers lying nearby on the ground -- but it will do him little good in these circumstances.
 As Riker, Worf, and TWO N.D. SECURITY GUARDS MATERIALIZE in the cavern. Tallera whirls around to deal with this new threat, but Picard makes a sudden realization and shouts to his officers...
 As the DISTORTION forms in front of him. He steels himself... tries to ignore it... closes his eyes... and then the distortion PASSES DIRECTLY THROUGH HIM without harm.
 Reacts... the effort tired her.
 keeps himself calm... as a DISTORTION forms and passes THROUGH HIM.
 Tallera sags to one knee... sweat pouring down her forehead... the effort is exhausting her.
 The ship in orbit around Vulcan.
 Picard, Riker and Data are walking through the Corridor. Picard is still dressed in his Mercenary outfit. Mid-conversation.
 DATA is walking along, carrying a PADD. GEORDI catches up to him from behind... out of breath, excited about something.
 Data walking along. Gradually, a RINGING SOUND is heard echoing somewhere in the distance. Data tilts his head in pain at the noise. The ringing is intermittent, and sounds like an old-fashioned telephone. A couple of rings go by. Data heads down the corridor to find the sound...
 As Data walks, the ringing gets louder. He sees something ahead of him... and stops at what he sees --
 a group of THREE WORKMEN. They are dressed in plain gray coveralls, holding old-fashioned PICKS and SHOVELS. They have removed a large section of the WALL -- visible within is a distinctive-looking WARP PLASMA CONDUIT. They are hacking at the conduit with the tools.
 Data bolts awake in his bed, as if from a nightmare. He glances around the room in momentary confusion... then realizes it was a dream. OFF his startled expression...
 The ship is docked at a STARBASE.
 RIKER and various N.D.s at their stations. PICARD ENTERS from his Ready Room, looking very grim-faced. Riker takes note.
 Geordi and Data are working at the "new" warp core, which looks slightly different than the old one: the dilithium chamber drawer has a new and distinctive design... and it is not active. (NOTE: This is a redress of the existing warp core set.) A couple of ENGINEERING N.D.s are working in the background.
 Picard, Riker, N.D.s, as before. Picard and Riker on their feet.
 The stars are static... indicating that the ship isn't moving. A long beat goes by.

 Dark, except for EMERGENCY LIGHTING. Geordi, Data and the N.D.s all quickly working.
 A while later. Data is sitting quietly by his desk, intently watching his cat SPOT, who is sleeping on the desk top. The door chimes.
 as he shuts his eyes. A long moment goes by as we PUSH IN on his face... then...
 CLOSE ON DATA as he opens his eyes. He is now sitting at a table in the room. There is an eerie and surreal quality to the scene. WE ARE EXPERIENCING DATA'S DREAM.
 sitting opposite Data at the table. He is eyeing a piece of CAKE that has a distinctive blue color similar to that of a Starfleet science uniform. Sitting atop the cake is a communicator pin, which Worf plucks off and sets aside. He takes a bite of the cake.
 sitting at the bar. BEVERLY is sipping from an opaque STRAW that is sticking out of Riker's temple. She seems to be enjoying the "drink". Tiny slurping noises can be heard.
 (as seen in the Teaser) are huddled around a table, engaged in some unseen activity. Data approaches them.
 lying on her back on the table top. She is staring up at Data with a frightened expression on her face. Her legs are gone and HER TORSO IS A GIANT CAKE -- made to look exactly like her real torso, blue uniform and all. A piece has already been cut out of her chest where the communication pin usually is.
 Data wakes up in his bed.
 A while later. Geordi and Data working.
 Early 1900's -- distinctly Viennese. SIGMUND FREUD is sitting in a leather chair, holding a note pad. This is Freud in his prime, with his trademark beard and glasses. He speaks in a heavy German accent.
 Data lying on an analyst's couch, staring up at the ceiling.
 Picard, Riker, Worf, N.D.s. Picard is on his feet, pacing, impatient.
 The image of ADMIRAL NAKAMURA comes up -- a stern-looking man in his late fifties. Picard smiles politely.
 Geordi, Data, Tyler, N.D.s at work. The warp core is ACTIVE -- glowing and humming.
 Picard takes a breath, looks to the Com.
 The Enterprise's engines FLARE brightly and there is the roar of the great ship going into warp -- but it does not move. The engines keep FLARING, brighter and brighter, then completely GO OUT.
 The warp core DIES DOWN and SHUTS OFF with a loud RATTLE. Alarmed, Geordi rushes to a console and starts working.
 As before. Picard is frustrated.
 hanging motionless in space.
 A while later. Geordi is working on one of the WARP PLASMA CONDUITS. (NOTE: It is the same kind of conduit the workmen were working on in the Teaser). Data and Ensign Tyler are working nearby. The core still RATTLES from time to time, and it's playing on Geordi's nerves.
 Data's hand is wrapped around it in exactly the same way that he was holding the over-sized knife in his dream. In fact, the metal and shape of the brace is very suggestive of the knife.
 stares at the image, disturbed by the memories it conjures. Geordi glances at him.
 Clearly visible on the back of Geordi's neck is a large ANIMAL MOUTH -- teeth bared and HISSING.
 steps back in shock. Suddenly, the RINGING SOUND is heard from somewhere in the room. Data turns at the noise --
 As Data turns -- everyone in the room is gone. Data is alone, and the room is completely silent, except for the ringing. Data looks around in confusion.
 walks up to Data. The straw is sticking out of his temple (as seen in Act one). He points to Data's stomach in irritation.
 Visible inside his stomach is an old-fashioned TELEPHONE RECEIVER -- and it's ringing. Data pulls out the receiver... puts it up to his ear to "answer the phone".
 As Data turns -- Geordi and Ensign Tyler are standing nearby, staring at him in concern. Geordi has just taken Data by the arm. Everything is back to normal.
 Data is holding the coil brace seen earlier, and he's contemplating it with a serious look. He's on his feet, pacing the room, determined to understand his recent experiences.
 as before, hanging in space.
 Picard sitting at his desk, talking to Admiral Nakamura on the desktop MONITOR. Picard is frustrated, and a little embarrassed.
 Geordi is at an OPEN PANEL, working on the same kind of plasma conduit seen earlier. Data and Ensign Tyler are working nearby.
 Are you expecting to have the problem fixed soon... or shall we send out a tow ship to bring you in?
 Geordi is at an OPEN PANEL, working on the same kind of plasma conduit seen earlier. Data and Ensign Tyler are working nearby.

 A short time later. Worf and TWO Security Guards are standing on either side of Data, keeping an eye on him. Picard, Riker and Geordi are questioning Data, who is back to his normal self. The mood is tense.
 Troi is lying on the surgical table, unconscious. She's dressed in a medical gown, and her right shoulder is exposed -- a MEDICAL DEVICE is covering the wound. Her eyes flicker open... she's starting to wake up, disoriented. Beverly moves to her. A Nurse is standing nearby.
 Data and Worf ENTER. The two Guards can be seen outside in the corridor.
 Beverly is standing next to Troi, who is still lying on the surgical table, semi-conscious. Picard and Riker ENTER. Beverly turns to them, urgent.
 As the light hits Troi's skin, it ILLUMINATES a previously unseen CREATURE. The creature is large and leech-like in appearance, frightening -- and it is gripping Troi's skin with several thin tendrils.
 As Beverly takes the light away. Reactions.
 Picard, Riker, Worf, Geordi and Beverly, middiscussion.
 Picard and Geordi talking to Data, mid-scene.

 Picard is standing inside the ARCH on the empty Holodeck GRID. Data is sitting on a chair -- his head is OPEN and a couple of high-tech CABLES connect his circuitry to a panel on the arch. Geordi is making adjustments to Data's circuits. Two Security Guards stand nearby.
 Picard and Geordi look around. Data is nowhere to be seen.
 We see the same setting and group of people as seen in the dream in Act One (the workmen are not present). Data, Picard and Geordi ENTER. The ringing sound has stopped. Data looks around the room, then walks over to a table where the "Troi cake" is lying on the table. There are several pieces missing, and Troi is now unconscious. Worf sits nearby, eating a piece of the cake. Data picks up the large knife seen earlier and begins to cut a slice out of her right shoulder.
 As seen before. Picard and Geordi are standing in the exact same positions, but Data is now lying on the analyst's couch. Data's "phone" is gone. Freud is holding an old-fashioned telephone to his ear. He hangs up the phone.
 Picard and Geordi in the same positions. They look toward Data, who is still attached to the arch. Data opens his eyes and looks at them.
 Beverly is shining the IP light on Troi's shoulder. We see the creature hugging her skin. After a moment, the creature DISINTEGRATES -- gone.
 Picard reacts with relief. A silent moment as they all exchange a look...

 Troi and Riker are sitting at a table. The usual compliment of N.D.'s, including TWO N.D. Cairn.
 Including Mrs. Troi, who stands behind them. Her face is intense and her eyes bore in to Riker.
 Where Troi watches as BEVERLY examines Lwaxana, who is calm now and full of regret.
 A thicket with trees, shrubs and flowers. Nearby is a small POND. A couple of N.D Crew Children are playing near the pond.
 Lwaxana lies unconscious on a Sickbay bed, Picard and Troi stand off to the side. Beverly is removing the CORTICAL STIMULATOR PADS from Lwaxana's forehead. She seems stumped, but tries to break her news to Troi gently.
 Troi and Picard are talking with Maques.
 Beverly, Troi and Picard.
 as she crosses toward her mother's bed. The lights are DIMMED for sleep, and Lwaxana is now in a hospital gown.

 Hours later. Troi has curled up on a bed near her mother's. After a moment, we hear the SOUND of the door to Sickbay opening... footsteps approaching.
 Picard, Troi, and Beverly are trying to find out what Maques was doing in Sickbay. He's a little rattled by what happened and it's affecting his speaking ability.
 Picard watches as Beverly and a NURSE set up for Troi's attempt to contact her mother. Troi lies on a bed next to her mother's, and Maques stands between them. Biomonitors are ON LINE for both Lwaxana and Troi.
 Looking up at Maques -- his eyes locked on hers.
 as Maques stands between Troi and Lwaxana. The WHITE NOISE grows in volume until it becomes hard to take.
 where Troi finds herself standing alone. But the corridor looks nothing like we're used to seeing -- it's dark, the perspective is strange... surreal -- as if we're looking at it through a distorted lens.
 revealing that a large WOLF is blocking her path. It looks at her with piercing eyes, its intentions unreadable... Troi is determined to get past it.
 as Troi runs down the corridor, the Wolf just a few yards behind her, vicious and intent... She rounds a corner and ENTERS the nearest door, which closes behind her.
 Troi's face registers recognition and astonishment when she sees a dark-haired man, her FATHER. He's about thirty-five and wears an old-style Starfleet uniform with Lieutenant's pips.
 As she returns to the dark and surreal part of her mother's mind. The dripping SOUND resumes. Troi looks around, unsure which way to go. She decides to return in the direction she came.
 as she stops in her tracks, shocked by something she sees.
 Revealing what she sees -- it is Hedril, standing some five yards down the corridor, looking at her with huge, accusing eyes. Strangely, she doesn't look Cairn -- whatever the anatomical differences are between us and them are not evident -- she has the dark eyes of a Betazoid.
 as Troi starts awake.
 Picard, Beverly, Data and Troi are talking with Maques and Hedril. The little girl seems a little afraid about having to face these strangers, and Troi tries to put her at ease.
 as it travels at impulse.
 Troi has her mother's VALISE on a table and is going through her things. It is a difficult thing to have to do, and her face shows it.
 Inside lies a small curl of dark hair, tied with a bit of ribbon.
 Troi smiles at this memento of herself and closes the box. Then she uncovers a photograph... it's Mister Troi in his uniform. She is gazing at it when the door CHIMES.
 Troi is lying on the bed next to her mother's. Maques and Beverly are preparing for her to go back into Lwaxana's mind. Picard stands next to Deanna.
 dark and ominous as before. From behind her, Troi HEARS the menacing growl of the Wolf.
 as Troi finds herself standing near the pond. She looks around, puzzled to find herself here. It isn't the pleasant environment we saw earlier -- it's dark, spooky. The dripping SOUND continues its eerie echo...
 Before Troi's astonished eyes a reflection takes shape... but it's not her face... it's Hedril's.
 Troi comes upon Lwaxana, standing staring out into the distance, as if guarding this place and its secrets. Her face is filled with sadness.
 The arboretum is now sunny and bright.
 The arboretum is suddenly dark and ominous again -- Mrs. Troi now sits alone on the grass.
 is sunny again. Troi finds herself near the edge of the pond. Lwaxana and Mister Troi are sitting huddled together by the water's edge -- he is drenched and exhausted. They look out at the water in shock -- they're devastated, numb. The dog barks by the water's edge, insistent (baby Deanna is nearby in her carrier).
 as she watches, her eyes wet with emotion. She steps toward her mother.
 has gone dark again. Her mother is alone by the water's edge, crying softly. Deanna kneels next to her, tries to comfort her.
 Lwaxana's eyes open, and a moment later, Troi's. They turn to each other, and both smile when they realize that their hands are clasped across the space that separates their two beds.

 Lwaxana and Troi are sitting on the couch, talking quietly.
 It's a picture of Mister Troi and Kestra. She's about eight, holding Deanna when she was a baby. She is beaming at the camera.

 as it moves away we...
 Orbiting an Earth-sized, blue-green planet.
 PICARD and BEVERLY are seated at the table, finishing up the last remnants of a large breakfast. The fare this morning consists of some strange-looking soup with the consistency of molasses and plates of exotic fruits. Beverly eats heartily, thoroughly enjoying every bite -- Picard is somewhat restrained... making vague motions at the soup and mostly contenting himself with a cup of tea and a biscuit.
 WORF is working at the console along with a N.D. Crewmember as Beverly and Picard ENTER.
 A small, dingy prison cell -- damp and inhospitable.
 The ship in orbit.
 DATA is on the platform, examining a raised section of the Transporter with a tricorder. Worf and RIKER are standing at the console.
 Picard is meticulously studying one section of the cell wall with infinite patience... he's looking for any way out of here. Beverly is sitting calmly against one wall watching him. They've been here for quite some time. After a few beats, Picard stops probing the wall and turns around to give Beverly a questioning look.
 Which shows a close-up view of the tricorder screen. The tiny monitor displays a complicated map with a path marked by arrows and text.
 Picard and Beverly study the monitor screen.
 Riker, Worf, and TROI are sitting at the table with AMBASSADOR MAURIC. The Ambassador is a distinguished, impressive-looking humanoid, with all the charm of a refined southern gentleman. Mauric is accompanied by an AIDE, who stands neatly at attention behind Mauric's chair.
 Worf leads Mauric and the aide to a door and enters the code on the keypad. The door slides open. Worf gestures to them to enter, but Mauric hangs back... looks up and down the corridor... into the room.
 Worf stands to the side as Mauric and the aide swiftly inspect the room... checking everything carefully as though looking for anything amiss.
 An empty cavern, a mile beneath the planet's surface. Utterly secluded -- there's no one about. Somewhere, off in the distance, there's the faint sound of water dripping.
 Worf stands to the side as Mauric and the aide swiftly inspect the room... checking everything carefully as though looking for anything amiss.
 An empty cavern, a mile beneath the planet's surface. Utterly secluded -- there's no one about. Somewhere, off in the distance, there's the faint sound of water dripping.
 Data is working at Science Station One. Riker and Worf are standing nearby. There is a complex OKUDAGRAM on the monitor.
 Picard and Beverly ENTER. They've reached what seems to be a dead end and they stop.
 The ship in orbit.
 The room has been changed from the usual guest accommodations. Some of the furniture has been shoved over to one side and the room is littered with SEVERAL ELECTRONIC DEVICES. The desk now supports a large ALIEN COMPUTER console with odd cabling and gizmos attached to it.
 Picard and Beverly come out from the caves. They blink for a moment in the bright sunshine, then Beverly points in a direction and they head out...
 Picard and Beverly carefully make their way down a tricky slope... picking through the brush, always looking around for any sign of pursuit. They look worn, tired and hungry. Silence for a while...
 A short time later. Beverly and Picard are walking along and then come to a stop. (From this point on, they should be no more than three feet apart at any time.) Beverly checks her map and frowns.
 As Picard is alarmed by something he sees in the distance. He's about to say something to Beverly, but she whirls around without his saying anything. They both duck behind some brush for cover and then cautiously peek out.
 Revealing TWO PRYTT TROOPERS walking along the ridge directly ahead of them.
 as they watch the Troopers. Beverly shakes her head -- responding to something she "heard."
 The ship in orbit.
 Worf and Riker walk down the Corridor and stop outside the Kes Quarters. Riker presses the door panel and the doors slide OPEN after a beat. They EXIT to...
 Riker and Worf ENTER and are immediately confronted by the Aide, who uses a Kes tricorder to carefully and thoroughly scan both Riker and Worf from head to toe. Mauric is seated at the table, his hands folded neatly in front of him while TWO N.D. Aides stand on either side of him. Mauric is looking at the Enterprise officers with a cool eye. Riker and Worf exchange a glance -- what's this all about?
 Beverly and Picard have stopped for the night in a small Cul de Sac, shielded from view by rocks and vegetation. Picard is tending a small FIRE as Beverly sits nearby scanning a collection of plants with her tricorder. After a beat, she reacts with disappointment -- Picard doesn't have to see her to know what's wrong.
 Riker, Data, and Worf at their stations. Mauric ENTERS from the Turbolift. His attitude is cool toward Riker... he clearly doesn't trust him.
 Riker and Mauric ENTER and find a very angry Minister Lorin standing in the room. She is keeps a handle on her temper, but she is coldly furious.
 Beverly and Picard are climbing a steep slope. Beverly sees something up ahead and she silently motions Picard down. They both duck for cover.

 As they double back down the way they came... trying to keep out of sight.
 As he looks around the area... suddenly he looks down and sees something. He lifts his weapon...

 Rushes to Picard's side, but the Captain gets to his feet with only a few bumps and scrapes.
 Riker's patience is just on the verge of running out.
 Picard and Beverly run toward the FORCEFIELD BORDER between Prytt and Kes territory. The forcefield itself is invisible unless touched, but the border is clearly marked by signs and by large stanchions which operate the forcefield.

 Beverly reacts to something she "hears".
 Where Riker and Mauric listen as Lorin communicates with the surface.
 The ship in orbit.
 Picard, Beverly and Riker ENTER from the Transporter Room walking down the corridor. Picard and Beverly are still dirty and bedraggled from their adventure. Midconversation.
 It's much later. Picard and Beverly are just finishing up the last remnants of an intimate dinner. They're both in civilian clothes and the mood is warm, inviting. Beverly pushes back her plate and looks very contented. The implants are gone.
 Beverly ENTERS and stops just outside the door... looks back... then walks off.
 Picard looks after her for a moment... then blows out the candles.
 The door CHIME sounds.
 Data ENTERS the bedroom to see GEORDI on his hands and knees, looking at something under the bed.
 at impulse.
 PICARD, RIKER, Data, TROI, BEVERLY, WORF, and Geordi are seated at the conference table. The mood is upbeat -- even though the mission is serious, it's still fairly routine.
 Geordi is at the warp core. The DILITHIUM CHAMBER is open and he is working intently on the innards with a TECH TOOL. Several N.D.s are working in the b.g.
 Geordi and Data are moving through a section of the VERTICAL JEFFERIES TUBE. They stop at a junction, and Geordi opens a MEESPANEL. He begins to work on it with a TECH TOOL as Data monitors his progress with a TRICORDER.

 Data and Geordi ENTER from the aft Turbolift; Geordi moves to Aft Science and Data moves to Ops, relieving the N.D. as Riker examines the readout of his chair console.
 The SHIP SHAKES again as another blast from the Ferengi vessel connects. Picard and Riker quickly bark out their orders.

 Picard and Data are studying an OKUDAGRAM on the monitor which shows a line indicating the course of the Fleming through the Corridor; the line passes near a debris field.
 A small alien ship stands facing the Enterprise.
 They are initiating their Transporter systems...
 Geordi is in his office, staring through the glass at the now-inactive warp core.
 TWO HUMANOID ALIENS, a male, RABAL, and a female, SEROVA, are standing in front of the inactive core.
 Picard, Riker, Data, and Geordi are at the table with Rabal and Serova. The two N.D. Security Guards stand nearby, phasers holstered, closely flanking the aliens.
 Geordi, Rabal, and Serova are working in and around the area of the warp core. All three have PADDS. The warp core is still dark. Serova works a console and the warp core begins to PULSE SLOWLY. She checks a panel.

 Data is giving his report to Picard as Rabal and Serova listen anxiously. Data is standing in front of a monitor which displays a SUBSPACE FIELD MAP of the Corridor (NOTE: this OKUDAGRAM should be based on the map seen in Act 1); several pocket-like regions inside the Corridor are highlighted.
 Sir, we've located the Fleming on long-range sensors, approximately zero-point-three light years away.

 There is one life form on board. It is Serova.
 The alien ship is seen only as a point receding rapidly deep into space. Suddenly, we see the FLASH from an EXPLOSION. A SHOCK WAVE radiates outward from the flashpoint, leaving a STRANGE GLOW in its wake...
 The SHIP SHAKES, buffeted by the shock wave. RED ALERT lights are flashing...

 Geordi stands quietly behind him until Rabal turns, noticing him. Rabal is subdued, his voice quiet.
 Picard, Riker, Data, and Worf are at their stations.
 Geordi is near the warp core.

 This is how they'll look in ten years...
 At the end, the rifts cover large areas of the sector. It's a shocking and chilling image.
 Thank you, gentlemen.

 In orbit around the planet Atrea.
 PICARD, GEORDI, and DATA look on as Atrean Scientist PRAN TAINER stands before an OKUDAGRAM depicting a cross-section of the Atrean planet. Also present is Pran's human wife, JULIANA TAINER, a fiftyish woman dressed in Atrean fashion. The Atreans are a humanoid species, only slightly different from us.
 Data and Juliana at a table. Her eyes are shining as she looks at him...
 as it orbits Atrea.
 Geordi is working at the pool table, Data is working at a separate monitor along the side wall.
 Juliana works alone, entering information on a PADD. VARIOUS SUPERNUMERARIES enjoy themselves, but Juliana is intent on her work. She takes a bite from a plate of food.
 Data is seated at a console, working. Juliana stands working at a nearby console.
 RIKER is coordinating the drilling process. WORF is at tactical; Pran hovers a bit fretfully, concerned that it will all go well.
 as a PHASER BURST lances out from the ship and down toward the planet.
 Data and Juliana watch the OKUDAGRAM -- a beam shoots down from the silhouette of the Enterprise in orbit, creating a well-like shaft in the planet's mass.
 the beam changes in intensity.
 The mantle is less resistant than I thought it would be --
 The drilling process has raised the temperature inside the magma pocket by almost three hundred degrees C. It will be several hours before it cools enough for us to enter.
 Data is playing a VIOLIN solo for Juliana, who listens, rapt. After a few moments, Data finishes. She applauds, clearly impressed with his playing.
 Data and Juliana are practicing near the windows.
 Data and Juliana are in the process of drilling the second shaft; Geordi works nearby -- the DISTINCTIVE SOUND that indicates the modified phasers are in use can be heard.
 Riker, Worf and Pran as before.
 as a phaser beam lances down toward the planet.
 Suddenly the ship starts to SHUDDER.
 as it orbits Atrea.
 Data and Juliana are calibrating one of the INFUSION UNITS -- the device is about the size of a two-drawer filing cabinet, has control panels on several faces, and should have some sort of receiving node on top that looks like it could absorb a phaser blast.
 she appears to be concentrating on her work -- nothing seems out of the ordinary.

 we can see from his expression that there's something about her playing that's got his attention.

 as they finish the piece. When the concert ends, everybody stands and applauds. Data and Juliana stand to take their bows -- and she beams happily at him, unaware that something is weighing on his mind.
 as Troi moves off. Data starts toward the door, as though on a mission, but Pran intercepts him.
 as it orbits Atrea.
 Data and Beverly ENTER.
 Data and Juliana ENTER and join Geordi, who has just beamed Pran and an N.D. Atrean out of the magma pocket where the cave-in occurred -- their uniforms and faces are dusty. As they move off the transporter pad, Pran walks with a limp, as if nursing a hurt leg. Juliana moves to help him.
 where Riker is monitoring the conversation.
 as Data and Juliana MATERIALIZE near the THREE PATTERN ENHANCERS, one of which is tipped over. Data rights it.
 as they move through it and pass out of frame.
 as they approach the INFUSION UNIT. Rubble strews the area, and it seems that the unit may have been damaged by falling rocks. Concerned, Juliana starts working one of the consoles. Already, the heat has caused her to break into a sweat.
 as he looks up into the shaft that we drilled from orbit -- it's cylindrical and smooth-walled, and although it's too dark to see much of it, we get the sense that it leads up through miles of rock.
 as Data studies his tricorder.
 We're reading an increase in seismic stress levels.
 as they head back the way the came. A small AFTERSHOCK causes dust and debris to fall from above. They hurry on.
 as they approach the ledge that drops down to the beamout point. They react to something --
 so that we see that the cavern floor where the pattern enhancers were dropped another thirty feet during the last tremor. Juliana and Data are standing on the edge of a precipice, there's no way to climb down its sheer face, and the pattern enhancers are strewn on the floor below.
 as they land on the floor below. Data is able to absorb the shock, but Juliana hits the ground hard and is thrown to the floor.
 Beverly and Geordi are examining the still-unconscious Juliana, who is laid-out on the center bio-bed in a hospital gown. Riker and Data stand nearby.
 amidst the blinking circuitry.
 With a holographic interface.
 Data is standing in the ARCH. No program is running so the GRID LINES are visible. He has a PANEL OPEN, and holds an OPTICAL CHIP in his hand.
 we can see that the chip from Juliana's head has been mounted on it.
 as Data slides the optical chip into a slot. The machine HUMS to life, and after a beat, a hologram of DOCTOR NOONIAN SOONG APPEARS on the grid. He's about sixty, and conducts himself with curmudgeonly self-assurance.
 Picard, Troi, Beverly and Data are discussing the situation.
 CLOSE on Juliana's open head panel -- a hand is reinserting the chip.
 to reveal Data standing over her at the bio-bed. No one else is in Sickbay. He finishes and closes the panel. A few moments later, Juliana's eyes flutter open.
 as it orbits Atrea.
 Data is saying goodbye to his mother. An N.D. stands at the Transporter controls.
 as it moves away we:
 At impulse.
 WORF is alone in the shuttle, shining his BAT'LETH SWORD with a cloth. He eyes the sword with satisfaction, then sets it down and moves to the helm. He taps a control. (NOTE: He faces the console, as though looking into a "camera".)
 Later. Worf and RIKER are walking along, midconversation. Worf is carrying his Bat'leth sword and trophy. He keeps looking around, nervous -- he seems preoccupied by something.
 Worf rushes in, looks around, ready for anything. No one's there. He seems relieved. Riker looks at him a bit oddly.
 TROI, BEVERLY, GEORDI, DATA and SEVERAL N.D.S as they rush out of the bedroom. Many hold birthday GIFTS -- others have party favors, noise-makers. It's the most human and obnoxious party you can imagine. They come up shaking his hand, offering birthday wishes, patting him on the back. Troi and Beverly kiss him on the cheek. Riker ENTERS during the middle of all this, comes up behind Worf with huge smile on his face.
 A few minutes later. Beverly is holding a large CHOCOLATE CAKE, which has many burning CANDLES on it. Everyone is singing the "For He's A Jolly Good Fellow", but with Klingon lyrics. Worf stands there awkwardly -- this is like torture for him.
 standing behind Worf. Worf didn't see the Captain come in -- and neither did we.
 Holding position next to the ARGUS ARRAY -- a huge subspace radio telescope (as seen in "The Nth Degree").
 Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, N.D.s at their stations.
 Troi is sitting alone at a table, working on a PADD (she's in her uniform and her hair is in a less elaborate, more formal style). Worf walks up to the table, eyes Troi a moment, thoughtful... then approaches the table.
 Data and Geordi are working at a console. Picard and Worf look on. Mid-conversation.
 The freeze-frame images of several FEDERATION OUTPOSTS and STARBASES comes up.
 as he takes the PADD. Suddenly, he is struck by a wave of dizziness. He touches his head and shuts his eyes for a moment...
 Data and Geordi are now both standing on the opposite side of the room, working at a console. Picard is nowhere to be seen. It's an odd moment -- as though in the blink of an eye, everyone changed positions. Worf reacts, confused.
 Worf is sitting on a bio-bed. Beverly is scanning around his head with a medical tricorder.
 Worf and Beverly ENTER. Worf immediately walks to the table where he set down Bat'leth trophy earlier. He picks it up, and reacts to what he sees --
 It is clearly a different trophy -- it's much smaller and less elaborate.
 Worf holding the trophy, shocked. Beverly looking on.
 It shows an image of WORF looking into the camera, sitting in the shuttlecraft, as seen in the Teaser. Everything is exactly as it was before -- the way he's sitting, what he's wearing, etc.
 As before, holding position by the Argus Array.
 Picard, Riker, N.D.s at their stations. Data at the aft science station. Worf ENTERS and moves to Tactical, relieves an N.D. working there. Data turns to Worf.
 A CARDASSIAN CAPTAIN (GUL NADOR) APPEARS. Picard tries to be diplomatic, but there is a definite tension in the air.
 A while later. Worf is pacing around the room, frustrated. Troi is there to help him through this -- her hair and clothing are in the casual style. She's sitting near Data's Impressionistic painting, which is still hanging on the wall as seen in Act One.
 The painting next to Troi is now gone.
 It is now a completely DIFFERENT PAINTING -- the painting is now of a KLINGON BATTLECRUISER.
 reacts in disbelief.
 Worf is now standing at Tactical -- he reacts, shocked by the change in setting. The ship is at RED ALERT. Picard, Riker, Data, N.D.s at stations. There's a CARDASSIAN WARSHIP on the VIEWSCREEN. (NOTE: The HORSESHOE CONSOLE should look different. And the Red Alert SOUND is also different.) Picard turns to Worf.
 Continuous action. Riker turns to Worf.
 Holding position near the Argus Array. It FIRES a series of PHOTON TORPEDOES...
 As it is HIT by the TORPEDOES.
 As before.
 Worf ENTERS -- he's agitated, determined to find out what's happening to him. He stops by the wall where the painting of the Klingon Battlecruiser is still hanging. He stares at for a long moment... then glances around the room... sees something and crosses to the table where the trophy was sitting earlier. It is gone -- and there is now a vase of FLOWERS on the table, along with several exotic-looking pieces of ART.
 The image of WORF comes up. He's in his quarters, in uniform.
 Later. Data and Worf are working at a console as Troi looks on. (NOTE: Data's EYES are not gold -- they are blue and human-looking. Also, the warp core looks slightly different, as it did in "Phantasms".)
 Worf and Data ENTER at the door directly in front of Beverly's office. DOCTOR OGAWA (she's wearing Beverly's lab coat) and Troi are Standing in Sickbay.
 A few minutes later. Geordi's body is lying on the surgical bed -- he's naked, covered by a blanket -- BURN MARKS are visible on his face. He's not wearing his VISOR. Worf and Troi stand back as Data picks up a medical tricorder and begins to scan Geordi's body.
 As he has a mild wave of dizziness, as before. We see that he is now dressed in a RED COMMANDER'S UNIFORM -- and he has three pips. (NOTE: Everyone's COMMUNICATORS are different, as seen in "Future Imperfect.")
 standing in the same area as Ogawa, who is now gone. She's wearing the lab coat. Worf reacts to the sight.
 Riker is sitting behind the desk -- he has four pips. He is the Captain. Data and Worf are reporting to him. There are minor changes in the setting: Picard's fish is gone and replaced with a plant... the book of Shakespeare is replaced with Riker's trombone.
 at impulse.
 Riker, Data and N.D.s at stations. Worf is at command. WESLEY CRUSHER is working Tactical, wearing a gold uniform. There is a CARDASSIAN N.D. working Conn. Various SET DETAILS are different: side panels, lighting, etc.
 It shows a QUANTUM FISSURE in the middle of the screen -- a very small GLOWING SPECK that is DISTORTING the area of space just around it.
 A short time later. Riker, Worf, Troi, Beverly, Wesley. Data is reporting to the group.
 The room is decorated the way it was in Act Three, except for one minor detail -- the painting is hanging back on the wall where it was in Act One, and it is the Impressionistic painting again. Worf and Troi ENTER together. Worf is agitated.
 Holding position near the QUANTUM FISSURE. The Enterprise is sending out a thin ENERGY BEAM into the fissure.
 Riker, Troi, Data, Cardassian N.D. at their stations. Worf looks on as Wesley works the tactical console.
 As the quantum fissure RIPPLES slightly, and EMITS A COLORFUL FLASH OF LIGHT. Suddenly, ANOTHER ENTERPRISE APPEARS... and a second later, A THIRD ENTERPRISE APPEARS.
 The Viewscreen shows the other two Enterprises.
 An amazing sight: HUNDREDS of ENTERPRISES can be seen stretching off into the distance, some of them close, others distant points of light.
 As before. Everyone staring at the Viewscreen in disbelief.
 As PICARD APPEARS. He's standing on the Bridge of another Enterprise. In the background, we see Riker and Worf (gold uniform) at their usual positions. Riker reacts to the sight of his old Captain.
 As before -- hundreds of Enterprises, as far as the eye can see.
 Later. Riker, Worf and Troi ENTER and walk up to Data, who is closing a panel on a SHUTTLECRAFT.
 As the Shuttlecraft LEAVES the ship...
 Worf at the controls.
 Riker, Data, Wesley, Troi at positions. Red Alert.
 One of the ships FIRES TORPEDOES on the other.
 As before.
 As before. But now we can see the QUANTUM FISSURE through the windows as the shuttle gets closer...
 As DOZENS of WORFS APPEAR, all identical but moving slightly out of synch with one another -- like an The SCREEN WASHES OUT IN A FLASH OF COLOR --
 Worf is lying on the floor, unconscious. His eyes flicker open... and he sits up and glances around. He rushes to helm, looks out the windows... sees nothing but stars...
 The Enterprises are gone -- the shuttle sits alone in space.
 Worf taps a control.
 at impulse.
 Worf and Riker are walking along, mid-conversation. Worf is carrying his Bat'leth sword and trophy, as seen in the Teaser.
 Worf ENTERS and glances around. No one's there. He sets down his trophy and sword and heads to the bedroom... pauses by the door expectantly, then bursts into the room --
 The room is empty except for Troi, who is standing by a small terrarium. She looks up, a little startled.
 CLOSE ON a banner which is strung across one of the walls. It reads "Captain Picard Day" in big bold letters. PICARD, TROI, and RIKER are standing in front of the table, which is covered by a variety of gradeschool level ARTS and CRAFTS. They all have something to do with Picard (paper-mache busts, crayon drawings, hand-written essays, dolls, embroidery, etc.) Picard regards the table with some embarrassment while Riker looks on with amusement.
 The two ships hang in space.
 Picard and Riker walking toward the Transporter Room.
 Picard and Riker ENTER. Picard nods to the Transporter Chief.
 Picard, Riker and GEORDI are seated at the table as Pressman moves around the room.
 The ship nears the Devolin system -- a solar system that never coalesced into discrete planetary bodies. It's a swirling disc of rock and other matter.
 Picard, DATA, Geordi, and WORF at their stations, Pressman standing near aft science with Riker.
 A WARBIRD DECLOAKS directly in front of the Enterprise.
 As before.
 Riker and Pressman are sitting at one of the tables near the windows with a couple of drinks in front of them. There is a familiarity and warmth between the two men... almost like father and son.
 The ship in the Devolin debris field.
 Picard is pouring drinks for himself and Pressman. The mood is relaxed and casual... two senior officers taking an opportunity to kick back and talk. Midconversation.
 Riker ENTERS, wearing a karate gi. He's holding his side in pain. BEVERLY moves to him.
 The ship is navigating through a large field of rocks and debris. Some of the rocks are moon or planetsized, others are simply boulders and dust.
 Riker, Worf, Geordi and Data at their positions.
 The Enterprise moves away from the Asteroid just as the Romulan Warbird arrives.
 Picard, Pressman, Riker, Worf, Data, and Geordi as seen at the end of Act Two. Everyone is watching the main viewer, where the Romulan Warbird can be seen near the Asteroid seen earlier.
 Pressman and Riker ENTER from the Bridge. As soon as the doors CLOSE behind them, Pressman turns on Riker with anger.
 Picard is intently studying a PADD on the table. The remains of a Japanese dinner are sitting on the table. The door CHIMES.
 The ship is moving through the Devolin system.
 Picard is talking to Admiral Blackwell on the terminal screen. Mid-conversation.
 Riker and Pressman are standing over Data at one of the aft stations. Worf is at Tactical. Picard ENTERS from the Ready Room.
 The viewer now shows a LARGE CHASM on the surface of the asteroid.
 The Enterprise moves down into the huge fissure (which is many times wider than the ship) on the asteroid's surface and the ship disappears from view.
 As before. Everyone is watching the main viewer, which shows a dark view of the interior of a vast and deep tunnel of rock which the ship is traveling through. There are small turns and adjustments that the ship keeps making to its course as it moves through the winding, twisting cavern. Picard is on his feet, moving from station to station, keeping a wary eye on what's happening.
 The screen now shows the starship Pegasus which has been FUSED into the rock of the asteroid. It is a bizarre sight -- the ship is half-in, half-out of the rock. There is some damage visible, but the ship did not crash -- it should look as if a transporter accident made it materialize partially in rock. Everyone reacts to the strange image on the Viewscreen.
 The ship is still fused into the rock.
 The engine room of the ship looks just as strange as the exterior. The room contains the usual assortment of equipment and consoles, but one entire wall is composed of SOLID ROCK. The floor and other bulkhead meld seamlessly into the rock face as if they were designed that way.
 Picard, Worf, and Data at their stations as Pressman and Riker ENTER (the device is gone). The ship is at RED ALERT. Everyone is looking at the main viewer, which shows a solid wall of rock -- some of the rock is still a molten red color, but it's cooling rapidly.
 FADE IN:
 Continuous from Act Four. Everyone is still looking at the sealed rock face on the Viewscreen. Worf reacts to something on his console.
 Sirol now appears on the screen. He seems very pleased with himself.
 The ship is still trapped in the asteroid.
 Commander, I've routed the impulse engines through the warp plasma conduits... but you'll have to watch the intercooler levels... if they go too high, we'll blow out the entire relay system.
 Riker is at the aft Engineering station. Picard, Pressman, and Worf look on.
 The ship is still inside the asteroid. Suddenly, it CLOAKS and disappears.
 Picard, Riker, Worf, and Pressman.
 The asteroid is sitting in space. The Warbird is nearby. Suddenly the Enterprise DECLOAKS outside the asteroid in normal space.
 As before.
 The ship moving at impulse power.
 Riker is pacing back and forth behind the invisible forcefield. Picard ENTERS the room and nods to the N.D. Guard. The Guard EXITS and Picard moves to the Brig entrance.

 PICARD and RIKER are at their stations; DATA is at Ops; WORF is at Tactical; assorted N.D.s man the other stations. The mood is serious.
 Worf is on the clamshell bed as BEVERLY scans his head with an OPTICAL SCANNER. A few additional MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS are nearby.
 A dark passageway in a cavernous underground region of the planet. We hear the familiar hum of the Transporter and then WORF MATERIALIZES.
 Worf is moving slowly and carefully, continuing to scan with his tricorder.

 approaches from another direction, leading another N.D. BORAALAN and an adult Boraalan female, DOBARA. Nikolai is a large, powerfully-built human, but as he comes closer, we see that his features are similar to Worf's -- Nikolai also looks like a Boraalan.
 Nikolai moves towards Worf.
 It's a larger, more open, section of the caves. Small collections of SUPPLIES, including a few ALIEN OIL LAMPS, are scattered throughout the area, suggesting that the Boraalans have been here for several days. There is a CAMPFIRE in the center, and off in a corner, an underground spring has formed a natural POOL.

 Picard and Riker reacts to the grim sight. Suddenly, the VIEWSCREEN image FRITZES OUT, filling with STATIC.
 shows the final moments of the planet as its last layers of atmosphere disappear. In a few moments, it's all over. The planet has gone from a verdant globe to a charred, barren rock.
 It's an incredibly difficult moment. Beverly looks down... Riker is deeply affected... Data's expression is unreadable... and Picard watches the Viewscreen unflinchingly.
 Worf is with TWO N.D. SECURITY OFFICERS; each person has a TRICORDER.
 as Worf moves down the hall, scanning. He stops in front of the entrance to a Holodeck and looks at his tricorder, puzzled. He taps the door control, but nothing happens.
 as Worf ENTERS, the DOORS CLOSE behind him. It's still dark, but now he can see Nikolai standing there, holding a PADD.
 It is identical to the scene that Worf saw on the planet. Everyone of the Boraalans is there, most of them sleeping, and nothing seems out of the ordinary.
 Worf pulls back from the hole and stares in shock at Nikolai. Worf doesn't even have to make the accusation.
 Worf and Nikolai on the move. Worf is barely listening--he's seething, so angry he can't speak. Nikolai, on the other hand, is energized, expansive -- taking relish in the ingeniousness of his plan.

 Picard and Nikolai. The scene is already in progress; Picard is furious.
 Picard, Data and Beverly are standing around the central globe as GEORDI, Worf, and Nikolai work at of one the large monitors.
 There are countless M-class planets in Federation space which could support the Boraalans. We'll have to narrow the parameters.

 as seen earlier.
 ENTER from one of the passages. Each man has a large, heavy SACK slung over his back (NOTE: Worf and Nikolai are back in their Boraalan make-up and costume). The Boraalans, including Vorin, gather around, overjoyed to see them alive.
 Tarrana is standing near the natural pool, obviously terrified. A BUCKET is on the ground at her feet.
 the Holodeck grid lines appear below the surface of the water.
 Dobara pulls back in fear and wonder. Nikolai and Worf exchange a look. Worf knows he has to come up with an explanation quickly -- as well as get rid of this Holodeck glitch. Since he's been forced into the role of Seer, he might as well play into it.
 Geordi is keeping an eye on the Holodeck and monitoring Worf's communications. But right now, he's looking a little puzzled.

 Worf sits alone in a corner of the cave, fuming. As he eats some simple food, he sees Nikolai and Dobara preparing a meal together across the cave. They're sitting close to each other, laughing and touching -- it all seems very intimate. The scene doesn't help Worf's attitude at all. He tries to concentrate on his food.

 What is this?
 Vorin is moving slowly through a passage holding a lamp, searching carefully. A look of relief comes over his face -- up ahead, he sees a SCROLL lying on the ground. But as he moves to pick it up, he pulls back in astonishment. On the wall in front of him he sees A PIECE OF THE HOLODECK ARCH sticking out of the cave wall.
 Vorin is moving down the corridor, confused and overwhelmed by everything around him. He passes a few N.D. CIVILIANS who give him puzzled looks. Vorin has never seen people like these and it terrifies him. He has to get away from them... He stumbles towards the Ten Forward doors which OPEN...
 The usual crowd. Riker and Troi are sitting together at one of the tables when the DOORS OPEN and Vorin ENTERS.
 By now, Riker and Troi have moved in to take charge of the situation. Riker motions to the crowd of N.D.s surrounding Vorin.
 Vorin is sitting quietly on the main Sickbed. Troi is nearby, staying close to him; an N.D. Security Guard watches Vorin warily. Beverly and Picard are off to one side, conferring in low tones.
 The Boraalans have emerged from the caves onto barren, rocky terrain. Everyone is loaded with gear in simple PACKS on their backs; a couple of people are also hauling TRAVOIS (a pair of wooden poles joined by a strip of canvas) loaded with supplies. Nikolai is in the lead with Dobara and several of the others. Meanwhile, Worf is helping Kateras over a rough patch of ground.
 begins to SHIMMER and DISSOLVE into the Holodeck gridlines (note: none of our characters sees this happening). The effect only lasts a few seconds, and the rock quickly returns to normal -- but it's clear that the Holodeck is breaking down.
 The Boraalans have made camp for the night. There is a CAMPFIRE and a few simple TENTS have been pitched. The tents are lit from within by the oil lamps, and the shadows of the Boraalans can be seen against the tent walls. The strains of an alien instrument can be heard in the b.g. It's a beautiful, peaceful sight.
 is off by himself in a secluded spot, talking on the com with Geordi. Worf is concerned and frustrated.
 Geordi at a console.
 as it enters orbit around Vacca Six.
 Picard, Riker, and Data at their stations.
 Geordi is working some consoles.
 Vorin is sitting in the middle of the room, clutching his scroll, lost in his thoughts, a man out of place in a strange world. The door CHIMES. For a second, he doesn't know what it is, but then he remembers...
 Worf and Nikolai are outside the tents, arguing.
 is beginning to shimmer, dissolving into gridlines and then reforming... it's a spectacular and terrifying sight (NOTE: the Holodeck simulation is completely falling apart here and the precise optical effects should reflect that).
 Nikolai and Worf exchange a look -- what are they going to do? At that moment, Dobara, Kateras, and several of the other N.D. Boraalans rush up and look fearfully into the sky.
 Geordi is working a console.
 The wind has started to blow... the camp is illuminated by flashes of lightning... thunderous booms can be heard... Everyone has to shout above the noise.
 It's a bizarre scene as the wind howls and lightning crackles. Worf and Nikolai check one last time, making certain that everyone is inside, and then...
 as everything MATERIALIZES in the same position and in what appears to be the same place -- except now it is a calm and peaceful night. (NOTE: this is now supposed to be the actual surface of the planet; it may be appropriate to make minor changes to the set such as placing various rocks in different places, etc.)
 in orbit around Vacca Six.
 Vorin lies dead on his bed. Picard watches grimly as Beverly pulls the sheet up over his face.
 Nikolai stands near their tent with Dobara as Worf approaches. Dobara looks at Worf a bit fearfully, uncertain if the two are going to fight again.
 as it leaves the planet behind.
 A traditional FUNERAL is in progress. A large group of MOURNERS, dressed in black, are gathered around a COFFIN. The setting is a SUNNY clearing surrounded by a large HEDGE. Stone-carved TOMBSTONES and other traditional graveyard details can be seen. PICARD and TROI are there, as well -- wearing their dress uniforms.
 As a hand-full of dirt hits the coffin... then another...
 Watches the coffin silently...
 As another pile of dirt hits... and another... and suddenly a single FLOWER is thrown onto the coffin -- a CAMELLIA, bright against the dark wood.
 reacts, looks up to see --
 is staring directly at her. His eyes are intense, face utterly expressionless -- he's striking and attractive but somehow strange. His skin is very pale, delicate, eyes a striking GREEN in contrast...
 reacts to the man, startled -- who is he? Before she can say anything, the man walks past her... and the procession of mourners continues. She glances back at the man, trying to shake the odd feeling. OFF her curious expression...
 A short time later. The funeral is over and many of the mourners are slowly starting to leave, while others have broken off into small groups, talking quietly. Picard and Governor Maturin are standing off to one side, mid-conversation.
 Beverly is standing by the graveside, where TWO N.D. COLONISTS are using old-fashioned shovels to fill in the grave with dirt. A mourner hugs Beverly, then walks off. A moment later Troi walks up and puts her arm in Beverly's.
 A large, open living area. The LIVING ROOM is adjacent to a SITTING ROOM... and there are doors to suggest other rooms. There is a stairway leading up to an offscreen second story. The decor should suggest an earlier time and way of life -- a warm Scottish country home from the early 19th century. Herbs and other exotic-looking medicinal ARTIFACTS can be seen throughout the house. And there are a few 24th century devices in evidence -- a replicator, computer terminal, etc.
 as she opens it to the first page, where the name and journal entry on it...
 Beverly begins to flip through the pages... intrigued by what she reads. She stands, still turning the pages, and walks up the staircase, disappearing out of view...
 After a silent beat, a NOISE is heard at the door -- the rattling of the lock. The door creaks open... and a man steps into the house. It's NED QUINT -- a dour man in his mid-fifties with a heavy Scottish accent.
 as she comes down the staircase.
 in orbit around the planet CALDOS FOUR.
 DATA is working at a console while Governor Maturin looks on. The wall monitor displays an Okudagram of the CALDOS COLONY. GEORDI and various N.D.s can be seen working in the b.g.
 Turbolift doors open and Picard and Beverly walk out, mid-conversation. Beverly has a hard case slung over her shoulder, and she's holding the leather-bound books seen earlier. As they walk down the corridor...
 Later. Beverly is lying in bed, under the blankets and dressed in her nightclothes. It's late. She's paging through her grandmother's journal, utterly absorbed by what she's reading. On the night table next to the bed is the exotic candle, as seen before.
 on the night table. The candle FLAME begins to sputter to life on its own, as if the flame is trying to come alive. It sparks and sputters but does not catch fire... and finally goes out completely...
 asleep, does not notice. Very gradually, the blanket starts to MOVE of its own accord... slowly pulling away from Beverly's shoulders as if by an unseen hand. Beverly draws in a sharp breath and tenses her body, reacting to something touching her face... then her neck...
 You dreamt you were in bed with someone?
 It is CLOUDY and OVERCAST -- a contrast to the sunny day seen in the Teaser and Act One. Beverly ENTERS the cemetery (wearing casual clothing) and walks toward her grandmother's grave. She stops at what she sees. Ned Quint is kneeling at the graveside. Beverly walks toward him...
 CAMELLIAS have been strewn all over the grave and tombstone -- dozens of them, everywhere. They were not there before.
 reacts. Suddenly, there's a FLASH of nearby LIGHTNING and a LOUD CRASH of THUNDER. Beverly reacts, startled. A WIND whips up -- the storm is right on top of her now. More LIGHTNING and THUNDER. Beverly turns and makes a run for it...
 Picard, RIKER, WORF, N.D.s at stations. Worf reacts to his console.
 An orbital view of a large, rapidly forming STORM SYSTEM over part of the planet's surface -- roiling gray clouds and crackling lightning. Reactions to the sight.
 Data and Geordi are working a console.
 The room is dark. Beverly ENTERS, her hair and clothing damp from the rain. THUNDER booms outside -- and LIGHTNING continues to flash in through the windows. The storm is getting worse. She leaves the door open and immediately searches for a lamp... finds one and turns it on...
 The house is FILLED with CAMELLIAS -- dozens of them everywhere, arranged to fill every corner and surface of the house.
 Continuous action. Beverly standing in the house full of flowers. Suddenly, the door SHUTS behind her of its own accord. She jumps, startled... then steadies herself.
 as Beverly ENTERS the room... looks around, but there's no one there. The room is DIMLY-LIT... blowing trees just outside the window cast spidery SHADOWS inside the room.
 As before, in orbit of the planet -- but now the ship is sending out a thin BEAM OF ENERGY through the atmosphere below.
 Beverly is sitting in front of a dresser, wearing a loose-fitting robe. She's relaxing, arranging a cluster of camellia flowers in front of a mirror. She eyes the flowers a moment...
 Picard and Governor Maturin, mid-conversation. Maturin is wearing a RAIN PARKA, and he's wet from the recent storm.
 Picard and Maturin stop at what they see. There is a dense, low-hanging FOG everywhere on the Bridge. Worf is frantically working his console. Data is on his feet, scanning the fog with a tricorder. Picard and Maturin walk to command.
 A small room lined with consoles and monitors that display various weather-tracking information. Many of the monitors are FLICKERING ON AND OFF.
 kneeling behind the console, frantically tearing components out of an opened panel. He looks intent on destroying the console.
 Later. Data and Geordi are working at the panel where Quint was ripping out components. Maturin is looking on. Beverly is in the b.g., kneeling next to Quint's body, scanning it with a tricorder (she's in uniform, wearing her lab coat). A MEDICAL N.D. is assisting her.
 on Beverly and the N.D. working over Quint's body. Geordi, Data and Maturin join her. Beverly stands and indicates the body.
 Beverly ENTERS (NOTE: It should still be dark and cloudy outside, the storm still in evidence). The camellia flowers are everywhere, as seen before.
 RONIN. It's the man from the funeral. He staring at Beverly with an intense look.
 As before, in orbit of the green planet. The energy beam is still cutting through the atmosphere.
 Beverly ENTERS.
 As before.
 Beverly is stepping onto the transporter platform, where several suitcases can be seen... she is holding the lit candle. A TRANSPORTER CHIEF is at the controls. Picard RUSHES INTO the room, carrying a PADD.
 Picard and Troi, mid-conversation. Picard is on his feet, tense. They're trying to make sense of the situation.
 It's dark and there are distant rumbles of thunder. Data and Geordi ENTER the cemetery, carrying Palm Beacons and scanning with their tricorders...
 Felisa Howard's grave. As Data and Geordi exchange a look...
 The room is dimly-lit... the exotic candle is burning brightly... the mood is romantic. Beverly is lying on the floor in front of the FIREPLACE wearing a loose-fitting robe. She looks peaceful, content. Ronin enters and sits down next to her. She cuddles against him and smiles.
 her eyes still closed...
 as he ENTERS the house. He sees Beverly sitting on the floor, seemingly in a daze.
 As before. Data and Geordi standing next to Felisa Howard's grave.
 who stares at the shocking sight of her dead grandmother getting out of her coffin.
 at impulse.
 Later. Beverly and Troi are sitting at a remote table, enjoying a drink.
 TROI and RIKER are sitting at a table looking over a PADD. The usual complement of N.D's fill the room.
 revealing a table in the corner from which four junior officers are watching Riker and Troi -- who can be seen in the background laughing over something one of them has said.
 Ben is approaching them with TWO COFFEES.
 At Red Alert, Sito is at Tactical, Lavelle at the Conn, DATA at Ops -- Riker is giving a series of rapid-fire orders from the Command Area. Various N.D's as needed.
 where Taurik, Geordi, and a few N.D's are listening.
 Continuous.
 Taurik is working at the pool table; GEORDI ENTERS and starts to cross past.
 Ogawa ministers to an N.D. PATIENT on a bio-bed, then moves toward Beverly's Office. She stops at the door and waits for BEVERLY to look up from her desk.
 Beverly sees her and smiles.
 as it drops out of warp.
 Sito is standing at the bar talking with Worf. A smaller than usual number of N.D's are in the room.
 who are at the same table we saw them at before, watching Sito and Worf. Ben stands with an empty tray -- there aren't many people in Ten Forward so he has time to talk.
 hanging in space.
 as Picard ENTERS from the Ready Room. Riker is in the command area, Worf is at Tactical, Lavelle at the Conn, Data at Ops.
 Moments later.
 where Taurik and Geordi are working.
 where they are monitoring the conversation.
 where Ogawa is helping Beverly prepare a bio-bed.
 as Ogawa EXITS to find Sito posted at the door.
 Riker is near an aft station, Data at Ops, Worf at tactical and Lavelle at the Conn. A group of N.D's ENTER from the Turbolift and stand ready to take their posts. Riker glances to see if everyone's present, then announces:
 where Sito is posted. She stands silently for a beat until the door to Sickbay OPENS and Picard steps out -- without breaking stride:
 as the door closes behind them.
 as Picard and Sito ENTER. He moves directly to his desk without offering her a seat. He seats himself and turns to regard her for a beat.
 Taurik is taking aim with a PHASER RIFLE. He FIRES and we reveal that he is shooting at a SHUTTLECRAFT sitting in the bay. Geordi stands nearby with a TRICORDER and watches as the BEAM hits the shuttle's aft section.
 as Ogawa ENTERS. Beverly approaches her with a certain amount of urgency.
 as it hangs in space.
 where Sito, Ogawa, Lavelle, Taurik and Ben are playing five-card stud at a table in the middle of the room.
 where Riker, Beverly, Troi, Worf and Geordi are also playing poker.
 as a chip lands in the pile at the center of the table.
 It is your decision, sir -- but if you give her a chance to prove herself, I feel certain that Ensign Sito will not disappoint you.
 Think so?
 Looks like it's just you and me, buddy. You in for another fifty?
 Ben starts raking in the chips.
 where Geordi is now standing.
 Good night.
 as Ben ENTERS from Lavelle's quarters and moves off.
 as the door CHIMES.
 Sito and a few N.D's (possibly Lavelle or Taurik) are filing out the door after a martial arts class led by Worf -- all are in gis.
 where Sito, now in uniform, is standing before Picard.
 where Beverly is working. Ogawa approaches her.
 as it hangs in space.
 as Sito ENTERS. Riker and Worf look up and gesture that she should take a seat. Someone else is seated in the chair facing away from her, but she can't see them.
 as it hangs in space.
 where Geordi is doing a last minute check on the shuttle. Joret is at the controls; Worf stands near the aft section. Sito ENTERS from the corridor, dressed in BAJORAN CIVILIAN CLOTHES. When she approaches Worf we see that her face is badly BRUISED.
 as the shuttle pulls out of the shuttlebay.
 Worf stands looking out the shuttlebay door at the stars... Off this moment we...
 at impulse.
 Joret and Sito are in the cockpit, both somewhat apprehensive.
 where Taurik, Lavelle and Ogawa are in midconversation. Ben stands nearby.
 as it hangs in space.
 Riker is in the Command Area, Worf at Tactical, Data at Ops, Lavelle at the Conn. The mood is grim.
 Stock shot of a probe being fired away.
 as they watch the probe disappear.
 Picard is pacing anxiously.
 Captain's Log, supplemental. We have intercepted a Cardassian report stating that a Bajoran prisoner escaped her captor... and was killed in an evacuation pod as she tried to leave Cardassian space...
 To all personnel with security clearance J-one and higher... this is the Captain. It is my sad duty to inform you --
 where Taurik is working as Picard's voice comes over the com.
 where Ogawa and Beverly are listening.
 where Lavelle and the others are listening.
 Her absense will be deeply felt by all who knew her...
 as it moves at impulse.
 Worf sits alone at a table near the windows. Ben approaches him with a drink. Sensing that he's lost in thought, he sets it down as unobtrusively as possible and moves off...
 as it moves away...
 The shuttle is heading toward the Enterprise.
 The lighting is DIM -- the night shift is on duty. BEVERLY in Command, ENSIGN RAINER at Tactical, other N.D. Crewmembers at their stations.
 A small village on Barkon Four. The level of technology on this planet is roughly equivalent to that of the Renaissance on Earth and the architecture, tools, and clothing should reflect this. The village has several storefronts and buildings, one of which is the Barkonian version of a small BLACKSMITH'S SHOP with the necessary equipment and tools out in front of it. The other storefronts should have practical doors and a few display tables (which are now covered by drop cloths). There is also a WELL visible in the center of the square.
 Standing near the entrance to the square. His hair is disheveled... his uniform ripped and in tatters... his combadge gone... he's carrying a large Starfleet CONTAINER (about the size of a briefcase) in one hand... he looks like hell. Data opens his mouth and tries to speak, but instead of speech, a horrible ELECTRONIC NOISE comes out of his mouth. OFF this strange and frightening image...
 Continuous from the Teaser. Garvin quickly pulls Gia away to protect her from Data. Garvin takes a couple of steps backward.
 On the lid of the container, there is a Starfleet logo and 24th century radiation symbol. It is also clearly marked "RADIOACTIVE."
 I wonder what these markings mean...
 The ship hangs in space.
 RIKER is practicing a difficult piece of music on his trombone, when the door to his quarters OPENS and Troi ENTERS. She quietly moves to a chair so as not to interrupt him. He finishes the piece and then looks over at her expectantly. He plays a couple of notes on the trombone which sort of emulate a "voice" -- the notes and the expression on his face communicate the words "how's that?" She smiles.
 A small home with a living room, a staircase, and a dining room. Again, the furniture and decor should be very pre-industrial, along the lines of a 15th century Italian villa. There should be a couch large enough for a person to recline on.
 The Town is now alive with activity. PEOPLE are moving through the square... shopkeepers are selling their wares outside the storefronts... someone is using the well to fill a bucket with water, etc. In front of the Blacksmith's shop, Garvin is showing the metal to SKORAN, the village blacksmith. Skoran is a large, burly man with powerful arms and what seems like a permanent scowl on his face. Data is standing nearby and he continues to draw curious looks from passersby in the b.g. during the conversation. He is now dressed in native clothes and his hair has been combed and parted in a new way.
 Suddenly, the wooden base beneath the anvil cracks and then COLLAPSES.
 The anvil comes crashing down on the leg of the Apprentice, who SCREAMS in pain. Garvin and Skoran rush to him.
 Later that evening. Data, Garvin, Gia, and Talur are sitting around the table, in the midst of dinner. Talur is holding forth again, very confident of her ability to explain everything. Mid-conversation.
 The ship hangs in space.
 The room is alive with activity and the ship is at RED ALERT. Troi is working at the pool table while ENGINEERS rush back and forth, trying to fix a problem. Geordi comes out of his office with a worried look on his face. Worf is frantically working a console in the b.g.
 Revealing Riker standing in the Arch with a PADD in his hand. He moves to Troi.
 Talur is teaching a group of CHILDREN in the center of town. The children are seated around her and busily scribbling on their slates as Talur lectures. Data and Gia are also in the class. Gia is wearing a necklace with a PENDANT made from the same type of metal seen earlier.
 Including the Blacksmith's shop. Data and Gia approach as Garvin is arguing loudly with Skoran.
 Garvin is lying on the couch as Talur finishes looking him over. There is a small bag with her medical herbs and primitive instruments sitting on the floor. Gia and Data look on with concern. Garvin's skin is beginning to show signs of radiation poisoning -- blisters, red spots, discoloration. Talur peers into Garvin's eyes... feels his forehead... then notices a tuft of HAIR on the pillow beside Garvin. She runs her fingers through his hair experimentally, and is surprised when a large amount of hair comes away in her hand.
 Data and Gia are leaving one shopkeeper's store with boxes containing writing paper, pens, glassware, tubes, thread and other material.
 How strong is the magnification?
 Troi is deep in the middle of studying for her Engineering test. There are PADDS strewn about her desk, and a large Plexiglass board is in the middle of the room with a complex engineering diagram on it. Troi looks tired, but determined as she traces a conduit line on the board with her finger and checks it against a PADD in her hand.
 Troi ENTERS.
 Data is hard at work in his "lab" in the dining room. Talur is standing nearby, looking on in fascination as Data sets up an experiment. Data is holding a cloth SCREEN about one foot square.
 There is a VISIBLE pattern of LIGHT on the screen. It should look something like the pattern from a shotgun burst.
 Talur looks at the screen with curiosity.
 The pattern of light DISAPPEARS.
 It would appear that the container is constructed from a material which can block or absorb the particles coming from the metal.
 Talur is putting the last of the metallic jewelry into the container. She closes the container and then moves to where Skoran and several other people are gathered around the very sick Garvin, who is propped up on a small couch. Gia is tending to his fever -- though she, too, is clearly ill. Skoran and the rest of the townspeople are armed with crude weapons.
 It is now several hours later and Data comes down the stairs. Gia is asleep in a chair nearby. There are many more stacks of paper and slides and beakers are scattered across the room to indicate the passage of time.
 The square is deserted. Data cautiously moves into the square... looks around to make sure no one is watching and then heads for the well. The well has a large wooden cover over it, with a few metal latches to secure it. Data sets down the bucket and is starting to unhook the latches when suddenly we hear Skoran's voice from o.c.
 A normal busy day in the square with people moving about and merchants hawking their wares. Riker and Beverly ENTER the village, disguised as natives. They look around for a few beats, then Beverly's eye is caught by a group of children walking through the square. One of the children is Gia. She looks completely recovered from her sickness. As the children pass by the well, Gia slows down and then stops, looking down at something on the ground. Beverly & Riker walk over to her.
 The ship in orbit.
 Data is lying on the table, still dressed as we saw him in the town square. There is a jagged hole in his uniform with some circuitry hanging out where the metal rod punctured him. Beverly is using a DEVICE on his head and checking the readings on a tricorder. Troi, PICARD and Riker look on.
 TROI and an N.D. TEACHER are supervising an art class. SEVERAL N.D. STUDENTS, roughly junior high-school age, are making CLAY SCULPTURES. Troi is here as a kind of Troi is standing with a twelve year old student, ERIC, who's working his clay into a shape vaguely recognizable as some kind of animal. Troi inspects his work, not exactly sure what it's supposed to be.
 as she leaves Eric and walks through the classroom. She approaches Data.
 is following a mysterious-looking COMET, a smoky chunk of icy material with a small GLOWING TAIL of gas coming off one side. On the opposite side of the tail, in the far background behind the comet, is a star -- a small disk at this distance.
 PICARD, RIKER, and Data are at their stations; N.D. STARFLEET officers man the other positions. Everyone is studying the Viewscreen.
 as Troi and BEVERLY ENTER, in mid-conversation. Beverly is carrying the 24th century equivalent of a GYM BAG.
 A short beat after they leave, a strange MATERIALIZATION EFFECT occurs: four pairs of lines suddenly appear on the "head" -- if there were a face, the lines would be running up the forehead, down the nose, and across both eyes in a four cardinal direction COMPASS DESIGN. OFF the mystery...
 at impulse, following the comet.
 Riker, WORF and GEORDI are at a table. Geordi has a TRICORDER in front of him, a PADD is next to it. Riker idly reaches for a small BOWL of bar-type snacks.
 The clay-modelling class continues as before -- including Data working next to Eric. But some of the students have moved on to other projects. Eric is working in front of a computer which displays a GRAPHIC clearly visible as text.
 A MASK -- a kind of cross between Venetian and Mayan. The lower face is open to leave the mouth exposed -- the upper section covers the nose and has holes for eyes. The cheekbones sweep down and outward -- like wings. The mask is a striking combination of the simple and the sophisticated.
 which displays a few dozen, individually distinct, alien-looking ideographic symbols -- ICONS -- which themselves are arranged in the same paired line, COMPASS DESIGN on the mask and artifact.
 Geordi and Data are working intently at the consoles. Riker is watching over their shoulders. A screen displays rows of normal alphanumeric characters -- and interspersed are several pockets of the alien ICONS, always grouped together in the same COMPASS DESIGN arrangement. (NOTE: As Riker and Geordi talk, Data's attention will become progressively more focused on the screen displaying the alien symbols.)
 Picard, Riker, Data and Worf at their posts. Geordi is at the aft science station. Worf works his console, glances up.
 The ship fires a wide phaser beam that hits the comet, which starts to vaporize slowly and spectacularly away. Hold for several dramatic beats.
 The sound of the phasers stops.
 as Picard and the others watch the steaming mass on the screen finally clear away. In place of the comet is an incredible, huge, Mayan-esque, geometric piece of technology, vestiges of the frozen gasses of the comet still clinging to its alien surface. It is decorated with the same type of ICONS that have appeared mysteriously on the Enterprise.
 Continuous. Everyone stares at the awe-inspiring object on the screen.
 The ship following the ancient object.
 The room is now dotted with ARTIFACTS -- on the shelves, on the desk, on the floor -- collected from all over the ship. They all share the same vaguely Mayan look we've seen before.
 On the back is a small symbol -- off to one side, as if not wanting to be the center of attention. It is the symbol of what we will come to know as the moon.
 Always in the background... smaller than the others...
 Data is sitting calmly; a section of his head is open.
 Data, his head plate now back in place, is moving around the room in an energetic, very non-Data fashion, curiously inspecting his surroundings as though he's never seen this place before. Geordi watches him, concerned.
 as before, travelling with the ancient archive.
 Picard, Riker, Beverly, Troi, and Geordi.
 The DOOR OPENS and Picard ENTERS. Two Security Guards can be seen standing outside. Data is on the floor, curled up tightly in a corner of the room (he is still in his "Victim" personality). As Picard approaches him, he recoils.
 Lots of activity. Riker is on his feet, Geordi is at Aft Science. Worf is heading quickly toward the Turbolift.
 It's overriding our control systems...
 Worf and Two Security Guards are hurrying up a corridor. They arrive at Ten-Forward and step quickly through the entrance.
 Worf and his officers are shocked at what they find. The room has been transformed. Tropical foliage is everywhere, green vines and huge, red, fern-like fronds. Half the tables are gone -- stone slabs take their place. The patrons are standing around in stunned silence.
 A powerful beam is being continuously projected from the Archive into the saucer section of the Enterprise.
 Like the rest of the ship, the room is dark and lit only by emergency lights. All non-essential personnel have been cleared, and Geordi and Worf are using tricorders to scan the vegetation and stone slabs.
 Emergency lighting only. A PHOTON TORPEDO lies on a cradle between the pool table and the warp core. A control panel on the torpedo casing flickers with several lights. Geordi works at the pool table console as Worf scans the torpedo.
 It is full of writhing snakes.
 Worf and Geordi react and jump back -- then they turn around and see the awesome IMAGE OF MASAKA which now fills the entire back panel of Engineering. A few vines are hanging on the walls.
 The ship still held by the beams from the Archive.
 The Bridge is dark, lit only by the emergency lights. The walls are hung with strange, ominous vines.
 as Masaka's mask looms over them.
 The others acknowledge -- this must be done.
 Even darker than the Bridge. The door opens and Picard steps inside. A small fire is burning on the other side of the cabin -- on the now dirt-covered floor. Data is crouched down besides it, warming his hands.
 The ship still being held by the Archive's beam.
 As before, only the emergency lights are functioning and ominous vines hang across several consoles; but now, the normal command seats have been transformed into simple STONE PEDESTALS.
 Picard, Riker, and Troi are gathered around Geordi. The screen displays a GRAPHIC of the TEMPLE SYMBOL drawn by the Elder.
 as Worf rounds a corner, where he meets Picard and Troi. Worf has a PHASER, Picard and Troi have TRICORDERS.
 Riker and Geordi. Geordi is tapping commands on his console.
 For a moment, nothing seems to happen. Picard, Troi, and Worf exchange puzzled looks, and then suddenly, the walls dissolve into...
 It's a huge, cavernous room that seems to have been carved out of a rockface. Stone slabs and columns are placed here and there, some adorned with engraved figures and symbols. Sitting on a raised platform is a GOLDEN THRONE in the shape of a solar disc. The group turns around, looking at the trappings, taking everything in.
 In the face of the column is carved two different images: Masaka's sun symbol is shown large and prominent in the foreground; but smaller, and to one side, as if receding into the distance, the small as Picard looks closely at the symbols.
 This is the first time I've seen these two symbols paired... That could be significant...
 Data is sitting on the floor, eyes closed, in the same catatonic-like state he was in when last seen.
 as his eyes abruptly snap open.
 As he stands. He moves toward a table which contains a richly colored version of the MASK he first molded in clay -- MASAKA'S MASK. He lifts it to his face.
 as the DOORS OPEN and Data, wearing the mask, steps out into the hall. Before the two N.D. Security Guards even have a chance to react, Data disables them both, knocking them to the ground unconscious. Without another look back, he walks on down the hall...
 Picard, Troi, and Worf are clustered in front of another STONE COLUMN, studying another glyph showing Masaka's sun image and the horn symbol. However, this time, the horn symbol is large and prominent while Masaka's sun is small and receding.
 Geordi is working his console as Picard watches anxiously; Troi and Riker are standing nearby. Worf is in the b.g. at Tactical. The mood is tense and serious.
 Data/Masaka is sitting on the throne.
 The temple is gone. Everyone is back in the corridor, reacting to the transformation. And to Data -- who stands before them, not wearing a mask (neither is Picard), blinking a bit in confusion.
 The ship at impulse.
 Data with Picard; Picard holds the mask Data wore as Masaka, turning it in his hands.
 Red Alert! PICARD, DATA and a few N.D's are dealing with what is clearly an urgent situation.
 where GEORDI and a few N.D's are trying to contain the situation. The WARP CORE is pulsing at an accelerated rate, giving off an enormous SOUND.
 The plasma venting system has engaged.
 where we can see DRIVE PLASMA escaping from the starboard nacelle into space.
 as RIKER and WORF scramble up the ladder.
 Acknowledged. Release the exterior hull plate. We may have to jettison the core.
 as Riker and Worf ENTER from a Jefferies tube junction and stop in their tracks at what they see -- their faces are lit by INTERACTIVE LIGHT as they take in the strange scene before them.
 facing the plasma stream, his face lit by its glow -- Riker can be seen behind him. Riker takes a cautious step toward him.
 at the console, working to free the controls.
 Riker has taken note of the fact that the plasma stream will soon dissipate -- he knows he needs to keep Kwan from jumping until it does.
 as it hangs in space.
 Riker and Worf are reporting what happened to Picard and TROI.
 where Geordi is working at a console.
 Geordi, the medical situation on Barson Two has worsened -- Starfleet has given us permission to exceed warp speed limitations so we can get back on schedule.
 We'll be able to give you warp eight if you need it.
 as Worf and Troi make their way down it.
 These are the smaller, windowless quarters. There are CHINESE and ALIEN ARTIFACTS in evidence, reflecting Kwan's mixed heritage. Everything is neat and orderly.
 as it travels at warp.
 as Troi and CALLOWAY ENTER from Sickbay so they can talk in private. The young woman is clearly destroyed by what's happened.
 as Troi climbs the ladder toward the nacelle tube.
 as she ENTERS from a Jefferies tube junction. No one is there, and the room is bathed by an eerie GLOW that emanates from the maintenance DOOR (which is DOWN, in position).
 as she moves toward the maintenance door, her face growing increasingly brighter.
 Troi is sitting on the center bio-bed, still shaken. BEVERLY is doing a TRICORDER scan. Riker and Worf stand nearby.
 as it drops out of warp.
 Troi is working at her DESKTOP COMPUTER TERMINAL, going over Kwan's personal logs.
 where Worf is standing alone at the bar, pensive. Behind him, we see Riker at a table with an attractive young WOMAN. After a moment he stands and approaches the bar to get a couple beverages.
 as it hangs in space.
 as Worf and Troi ENTER from the Jefferies tube. The room is bathed by the eerie light that comes through the window in the maintenance door.
 as she looks into the plasma stream, her face lit by its glow. Suddenly we hear a jarring, percussive SOUND. Troi reacts and we --
 a WOMAN is standing a few yards away from her, looking directly at Troi, terrified. She's wearing an Engineering jumpsuit, and appears to be in her thirties.
 as her head snaps back. She looks around the room, which is back to normal -- she's disoriented by the bizarre image that suddenly appeared in her mind.
 a MAN is staring at her -- intent, menacing. His face is a little hazy, as if we're looking at him through a tinted glass. He too is in his thirties, and wears an Engineering jumpsuit. From what little Troi can see, he also appears to be in the unfinished control room.
 reeling back from the jarring image. She looks around, disoriented, and is stunned to see that the room around her has changed.
 As Troi looks down toward the injector and sees that a panel in the injector room wall is off, exposing a power conduit underneath.
 Worf, where are you?
 as the junction comes into her view -- she sees a man and woman locked in a passionate and furtive embrace.
 Troi backs away, and is startled when she bumps into a large figure. She turns, not knowing what to expect --
 holding Troi by the shoulders, trying to shake her awake. The control room around them is back to normal.
 where Picard, Beverly and Data are conferring with Troi and Worf about what happened.
 Troi is working at an aft science station, looking through pictures of Starfleet personnel. She's clearly been at it for some time now. Data has the bridge, and N.D.s man the various stations.
 where Troi and Worf are talking with PIERCE. He's human, in his mid-thirties, with reddish hair and piercing eyes. He wears a gold Engineering uniform.
 as they move down it.
 as they cross to her desktop COMPUTER. Troi sits and starts working the controls. Worf stands looking over her shoulder. After a moment.
 where we find Troi asleep in her bed. After a moment, Worf ENTERS the bedroom area, dressed in his uniform. He sits on the side of the bed and gently wakes her.
 where Beverly is giving Troi a HYPO-SPRAY. A few N.D.s are working in the corner, assembling the MEDKITS for Barson Two.
 as Troi ENTERS. The plasma stream is disengaged and the maintenance door is open. Data is on the main level, scanning with a TRICORDER. Geordi is up on the catwalk, scanning a bulkhead with a SPECIAL DEVICE. NARA is manning a console.
 we can see the injector room behind them, with the plasma injector jutting up from the floor, and beyond it, the nacelle tube itself -- running tunnel-like into the distance.
 looking down into the injector room. She gestures to a point on the wall.
 Troi watches from above as the they enter the injector room and cross past the injector, heading for the point on the wall she indicated.
 as she climbs down the ladder and moves toward Lieutenant Nara.
 as Troi ENTERS. She looks over to see Data and Geordi lifting off the wall panel.
 as we hear the same distinctive JARRING SOUND and her head snaps back slightly --
 the face of the terrified woman flashes before her eyes -- again, Troi's POV indicates that she is standing in the control room while it is under construction.
 as she snaps out of it -- disoriented...
 Lieutenant Pierce's face -- staring at her, menacing --
 as Troi snaps out of her hallucination; Geordi is rushing toward her --
 where in an almost X-RAY LIKE EFFECT, we can see that there are bone fragments embedded in the wall behind the conduit. They are parts of a human skeleton -- a forearm and hand... part of a skull... a few ribs, connected to the sternum.
 where Beverly is giving Troi another suppression HYPO. Worf stands nearby.
 as they ENTER from Sickbay and start down it. Troi glances at Worf as they approach the Turbolift -- something's on her mind.
 Deck ten.
 where Troi, no longer in uniform, is getting a CUP of tea from the Replicator. The door CHIMES. She smiles, expecting Worf.
 Troi and Lieutenant Pierce stand facing each other. Troi activates her combadge.
 as Troi approaches the door to Ensign Calloway's quarters. She reaches up and is about to ring when she thinks better of it.
 On Troi as she ENTERS to find Worf and Calloway in a passionate embrace. They turn toward her, caught -- Worf looks at her, not knowing what to say. Troi can't believe it, she's devastated, betrayed...
 as Troi ENTERS from Calloway's quarters. She runs down it -- she wants to get away, she has to get away from here --
 as Troi pushes her way past several startled N.D's and comes to a door... it OPENS and admits her to --
 a room similar to the one right off main Engineering -- she starts up the ladder.
 as Troi ENTERS. The room is deserted, dark -- lit only by the glow of the plasma stream through the maintenance door.
 as she stares at the coursing stream... she seems calmed by it...
 is suddenly bright again. It's Worf, alive -- in a single fluid move he pulls her away from the fiery opening. Troi is startled to find herself in his grip.
 as it moves at impulse.
 Picard, Troi, Worf and Data are discussing what happened.
 Picard, Data and Worf cross to their posts. Troi heads for the Turbolift.
 The room is bustling with activity -- it's one of those days in Sickbay. RIKER is lying face-down on a biobed, and OGAWA is very carefully removing some long, nasty-looking THISTLES that are sticking out of his back.
 who is scanning BARCLAY with a medical tricorder. Barclay is sitting on a bio-bed with a worried expression. Mid-conversation.
 as she passes by a Medical N.D. who is working on another patient. She checks progress on the patient... nods her approval... then moves over to Riker and Ogawa. Riker is still on his stomach, Ogawa removing the last remaining thistles.
 holding position just outside an ASTEROID FIELD (as seen in "Booby Trap").
 PICARD, RIKER, Data, WORF and ENSIGN DERN at their stations. Worf is enjoying himself immensely -- he's in his element. Picard, on the other hand, seems a little bored.
 as it FIRES THREE TORPEDOES at the asteroid field. Two of the torpedoes find their targets -- two asteroids are VAPORIZED in a spectacular BLAST of fiery debris. But the third torpedo VEERS AWAY and flies off into space, disappearing in a crazy trail off into the distance...
 As before. Reactions to the sight.
 Data and Barclay are staring down at the bed, where Spot is lying down. Barclay looks surprised.
 as a SHUTTLECRAFT leaves the ship...
 Later. Riker, Ensign Dern and N.D.s at their positions. Worf is working at the aft science station, looking agitated. He taps a few controls, then slams his fist down on the console in aggravation. Riker walks up behind him, leans in close.
 CLOSE ON Worf, who is sitting alone at a table, eating from several plates FILLED with exotic-looking MEATS and other strange-looking FOOD. He eats hungrily, quickly, tearing into the meat with Klingon vigor. There is an almost feral quality to his behavior -- a subtle but growing change in his personality...
 Later. The room is DARK. Worf is lying in bed, dressed in his nightclothes, trying to sleep. He tosses and turns for a moment, restless... then his eyes shoot open. He sits up and glances around with the room... jumps off the bed and begins to move around the room in search of something... his movements quick and predatory, strange. Worf is changing... some sort of primordial instincts taking over...
 GEORDI and Barclay are reporting to Riker. Barclay is very animated throughout the scene, bristling with nervous energy and mannerisms -- even more so than usual. It is a very subtle behavioral change, the foreshadowing of a more radical transformation. Riker, on the other hand, seems a little slow -- one step behind the others. This is the subtle beginnings of Riker losing his intellectual capabilities.
 Troi is standing watch, dressed in her uniform. Worf is working at Tactical. He looks sullen and somewhat disheveled -- his hair is slightly mussed and his uniform is wrinkled. Ensign Dern and N.D.s at stations. Troi shivers a little, cold.
 Barclay and Geordi crawling along, Barclay carrying the equipment case. Barclay is crawling quickly and with great skill -- Geordi can barely keep up. They come to a stop at a CORRODED PANEL that looks like it's been eaten away by acid.
 Troi is in uniform, drinking a large glass of water. She drinks the entire glass, then immediately fills the glass from a nearby pitcher of water.
 A small but comfortable room with a large, luxurious BATHTUB. Troi paces for a moment, edgy -- she shivers -- the tub isn't filling fast enough and she needs to get warm! In a bizarre moment, she crawls into the tub IN UNIFORM and sits under the faucet, splashing water onto her face and body. As she struggles to keep wet and warm...
 Worf, Dern, N.D.s at stations. Riker ENTERS, moves to Command. He reacts to the temperature in the room.
 The room is now filled is STEAM. Troi is still lying in the tub in her uniform, luxuriating in the hot water (the tub is now filled). She closes her eyes and exhales in a long, sensuous breath. She rolls her head around for a moment and opens her eyes...
 Worf is standing over her -- a strange and eerie figure in the swirling mist.
 who is startled to see Worf in her bathroom.
 A short time later. Troi is lying on a bio-bed, wrapped in a blanket. She is shivering, cold. Ogawa is treating the nasty-looking bite-wound on her cheek. Beverly is scanning her with a tricorder.
 who is sitting on a bio-bed, staring into middle distance. His mouth is open and he is breathing heavily. He ignores Beverly as she comes over and scans him with a tricorder.
 There is a small, veiny POUCH on Worf's neck just below the jaw line, back towards his ear.
 Beverly reacts to the strange sight.
 as before.
 Riker, Ogawa and Barclay. Throughout the scene, Riker seems a little slow -- one step behind the others. His ability to think is getting worse. Mid-conversation.
 seen earlier, at impulse.
 Data at the helm. Picard in back examining a PHOTON TORPEDO. Data reacts to the console, puzzled.
 as it flies into view of the ENTERPRISE, which is floating ADRIFT in empty space. The great ship is slowly ROLLING, tumbling through space in an aimless barrel roll...
 Picard and Data looking out the windows at the offscreen ship.
 The shuttlecraft flies toward the ship, slowly ROTATING at the same angle and rate as the Enterprise...
 The room is DARK, lit by emergency lights only. Cargo containers are strewn about -- the room is in a state of disarray. Picard and Data's shuttlecraft is now parked in the bay, its door OPEN. Picard and Data step out of the shuttle, phasers drawn, holding palm beacons. They look around the empty room... then Data moves to a wall panel, taps it.
 Picard and Data ENTER the DARK corridor and start walking, aware and ready for anything. Somewhere in the distance we can hear strange ANIMALISTIC SOUNDS -- howls... screeches... clicks... distant CRIES of pain... strange and eerie.
 Picard and Data ENTER. The room is filled with a light MIST -- it's like the inside of a greenhouse, damp and hot. Picard moves to a desk console, checks it.
 Picard and Data ENTER the steamy room. Picard sees the bathtub, which is completely filled with water. He moves to it and stares down into the water --
 is visible beneath the water's surface. She's in uniform, lying face-down, hair drifting in the water. She looks dead.
 Picard and Data ENTER the DARKENED Bridge. There are SCRATCH MARKS on the walls, and one of the aft consoles has been SHATTERED. There is a dead crewmember on the floor -- it's Ensign Dern. They quickly move to Dern, who has nasty-looking scratch marks on his face, uniform in tatters. Data scans him.
 Picard and Data ENTER and see --
 who is banging and clawing at the fishbowl, trying to get at the fish inside.
 A short time later. The room is DARK. Picard and Data are standing next to the operating table, where the proto-humanoid Riker is lying unconscious. Data is working the controls on the table. Picard is injecting Riker with a hypospray.
 Picard and Data ENTER and move to Data's desk. Almost immediately, we hear the sounds of MEWING KITTENS.
 where sitting in the middle of Spot's toys is a large, cat-sized IGUANA -- it is wearing Spot's collar.
 Picard and Data ENTER the room with caution, their phasers drawn, ready for anything. The room is DARK and various consoles are FLICKERING on and off. Data moves to the pool table, starts to work.
 in Geordi's office. Picard moves to a console and stops. The console is covered in gossamer strands of FIBROUS MATERIAL -- web-like, strange. He looks around -- the fibers are everywhere, some of the fibers are even hanging from the ceiling...
 who has transformed into a horrible cross between human and SPIDER. His EYES are black and bulbous -- and he has three smaller EYES growing out of his forehead. His skin is mottled with distinctive colorations and hairy CILIA. His hands are completely unrecognizable -- hooked and terrible. Barclay is BANGING against the glass, trying to get at Picard.
 hanging in empty space.
 CLOSE ON Nurse Ogawa who is transforming into a PROTOHUMAN. Her brow, forehead and jaw region are more pronounced... her face and shoulders are covered with HAIR. She is lying unconscious on the operation table underneath the CLAMSHELL. Data is working the controls. The Troi/Amphibian can be seen lying on a bio-bed nearby, covered with a blanket, unconscious. Riker is also there, unconscious. Picard is in the b.g., phaser drawn and pacing around the room, his primal instincts growing by the minute...
 Continuous action. Picard and Data, tense. Worf SMASHING loudly against the door outside. Picard adjusts his phaser.
 Picard ENTERS, the hypospray in one hand, phaser in the other. He immediately moves to the opposite wall, presses his back close against it. He steels himself, then slowly peers around the corner...
 of Worf, who can be seen pounding on the door to Sickbay. He is barely visible in the darkness, a hulking form. We should get the merest glimpse that he has gone through a remarkable transformation into something larger and more powerful. (See description below.)
 quickly pulls back... he reaches around the corner with the hypospray... then sprays the pheromones into the air with a HISSING sound. A long beat goes by... and the pounding noise stops. Picard listens carefully... silence... then pounding FOOTSTEPS are heard coming his way. It's working! Worf lets out a mating HOWL, as heard before.
 Data is working at the large WALL MONITOR, trying to get the computer on-line.
 Quick action. Picard running down the corridor, spraying pheromones into the air as he goes. We can hear Worf's FOOTSTEPS not far behind. Picard comes to an intersection, ducks into another corridor and sprays the pheromones down that hall... sprays some more all around the intersection itself in an attempt to confuse Worf. He runs down a third corridor...
 (Near the Transporter Room set.) Picard ENTERS and runs down the long hall... and stops. He's at a deadend. He turns to go back, but the FOOTSTEPS are rapidly approaching. No time. He quickly moves to the Turbolift and taps the control pad. Nothing happens. Picard works at the control pad, desperately trying to get the door open... suspense building as the footsteps are getting closer and closer...
 standing at the far end of the hall, looking directly at him. This is the first time we get a real look at the de-evolved Klingon. His HEAD has been utterly transformed -- his RIDGES are huge and curved, bristling with sharp edges and pointed angles. The ridges extend downward, encasing his entire face. His jaw and mouth region are protected by the same hard, black chitin-like material, and a LARGE MANDIBLE is snapping open and shut. Worf is hunched over, his body bulkier, more powerful, uniform torn in places. This is a Klingon from millions of years ago -- prehistoric and terrifying.
 turns and enters the Turbolift...
 rushing toward Picard...
 The doors close just as Worf reaches them. The Lift is JOLTED as he hits the doors from the outside.
 Data at the operating table. He INJECTS Ogawa with a hypospray, then looks at the wall monitor.
 Picard is crawling vertically through the narrow passageway. He stops at a hatch... moves to one side, cautious -- holds his phaser ready and hits a control by the door...
 Picard ENTERS from another Jefferies Tube and stands upright. He moves to another set of doors, but stops when a sudden NOISE echoes somewhere nearby. He stops and cocks his head, listening closely much like an animal would. He eyes the doors with concern... levels his phaser at the doors and hits a control --
 Worf is staring down at him from beyond the grating, in the Jefferies Tube above. He ROARS ferociously.
 grabs his arm, which is covered with ACID BURNS from the venom. He struggles to his feet, heads into the horizontal Tube...
 The wall monitor shows that the DNA strand has now FROZEN and looks more normal than before.
 Picard struggling to make his way down the horizontal passage. An access hatch opens behind him -- it's Worf. The Klingon starts after him. It's a tense chase down the crawlway until --
 as Picard reaches an opened panel -- it's the same acideaten panel seen in Act Two. The power cable which Barclay re-routed earlier is still visible stretching across the Tube. Picard grabs hold of it, RIPS the cable from the panel with a fritzing sound. The end of the cable is CRACKLING with PLASMA ENERGY. He aims it at Worf.
 as the ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE JEFFERIES TUBE LIGHTS UP WITH AN ELECTRICAL FLASH. The panel cover that Picard is crouching on is unaffected, and this protects Picard from the plasma charge. Worf is JOLTED violently, then he collapses. Picard removes the cable from the metal grating... stares at the figure of Worf, who is still breathing heavily... unconscious.
 Data working on Ogawa, who has completely returned to normal. She looks pale, sweaty -- her body has been wracked.
 As before.
 at impulse.
 Barclay is sitting on a bio-bed, in uniform. Beverly is scanning him with a tricorder. Troi is sitting on the bed next to them (she's normal now), being treated by a Medical N.D. In the b.g., other crewmembers are visible lying on the beds, being treated by Medical N.D.s. Mid-conversation.
 The ship in orbit around a planet.
 BEVERLY and WESLEY ENTER from the Corridor. Wesley is wearing his cadet uniform and is carrying a suitcase.
 PICARD is setting a teapot on the table where a small tea service has been laid out. There is also a plate of small sandwiches, and a tray of odd-looking crackers. Riker ENTERS.
 The ship goes into warp.
 Wesley is sound asleep in bed. His things are scattered across the floor -- not the neat and tidy room one would expect from a Starfleet Cadet. The door CHIMES. Wes groans and rolls over, trying to ignore it. The door CHIMES again. Wesley finally sits up in irritation.
 Geordi is working at the pool table as Wesley ENTERS wearing civilian clothes.
 The ship is in orbit around a planet.
 A large room, which in contrast to the rest of the village is almost completely 24th century in design and in building materials. There is a large, broad table with chairs, but no other furniture. Seated on one side of the table are five leaders of the Indian Tribal Council -- each of them wearing distinctive accoutrements which indicate their respective tribes, but all in essentially modern dress. On the other side of the table are seated Picard and Troi. The atmosphere is cordial, but a little stiff. There are several PADDS on the table.
 The ship in orbit.
 Wesley is sitting in a chair with a bored, disinterested look on his face. Beverly is walking around the room in obvious concern and frustration.
 A reception for the Indians is in progress. There is a banquet of food and drink set out and there are numerous N.D. Crewmembers mingling with N.D. Indians. All six tribal leaders are here as well as Picard, Riker, Troi, Data, Beverly.
 Are carrying drinks over to the window. Picard is using this social gathering as an opportunity to explore other solutions with Anthwara. Midconversation.
 As he ENTERS the room. He's wearing his cadet uniform again, but he doesn't look especially happy to be here. Beverly catches his eye as she passes him on her way to the bar.
 Beverly is on her feet, moving about the room, obviously very upset and concerned. Picard listens patiently, trying to help.
 Wesley is walking through the village in his uniform. He looks a little uncomfortable here... unsure what he should be doing or not doing among these people. He looks around for Lakanta, but doesn't see him among the Indians, who basically ignore him.
 Picard and Troi are meeting with the Tribal leaders again. The mood is tense -- they've gotten nowhere.
 Picard and Troi come down an alley way and then Picard stops short as he runs into Worf, who is standing in the plaza with Two N.D. Security Guards.
 Continuous from Act Three. Picard steps forward to confront the Cardassians. A large group of Indians watch the following.
 The Habak is a ceremonial chamber of great importance to the Indians. The Habak is located in a high tower and the only way in is through a ladder leading from a hole in the floor. The room itself is rectangular.
 Picard is talking to Necheyev on the monitor. Riker sits nearby. Mid-conversation.
 Several hours later. The firepit is glowing with embers which cast strange shadows on the walls and ceiling... smoke is filling the room and there is a moody feel to this place. Wesley is still sitting on the floor across from Lakanta.
 Is showing some signs of strain and fatigue... his eyelids keep threatening to close... a layer of sweat is covering his entire body... he's on the verge of falling over from exhaustion. His eyes close for a moment... he opens then with difficulty -- and then they widen in surprise at something he sees.
 Revealing that Lakanta is gone. Suddenly Wesley HEARS a man's voice calling to him as if from a great distance...
 The smoke in the Habak suddenly dissipates and Wesley finds himself standing in the Village... all trace of sweat on his face now gone... his fatigue has vanished. The Village now appears to be a strange, surreal place... there are several Indians scattered throughout the plaza... some on different levels... and all wearing Mansara masks and costumes... no human faces to be seen... a BONFIRE is burning brightly in the center of the plaza and it throws weird shadows and light over the scene.
 Dad -- wait!
 But it's too late -- Jack steps into the shadows and he's gone. Wesley takes a step to follow him and then...
 Wesley is sitting on the floor of the Habak again, his eyes closed as he experiences his vision. He opens them slowly to see Lakanta is gone and the fire is out. How much time has passed? Wesley blinks a few times, trying to readjust to the here and now. He pauses for a moment... then gets up and moves to the ladder.
 Wesley walks through the village... his mind swirling with images... sounds... the message from his dead father.
 A man is standing on one of the upper levels, wearing a Mansara mask and costume as seen in Wesley's vision. No one else notices him and the man stands stock still, looking down at Wesley.
 Who reacts.
 The man is gone.
 Who is starting to think about what Worf is doing and the implications for these people.
 Wesley is coming to a decision as Worf works his tricorder in the b.g. He's beginning to realize that these people now mean a great deal to him... he has to do something.
 Lakanta is standing in the crowd, staring at him.
 Wesley looks at the apparition of Lakanta.
 Lakanta is gone.
 Worf looks up. They've caught the attention of a couple of passing Indians.
 A fuming Picard is pacing back and forth in front of Wesley who is seated at the table.
 Beverly is here and she's just as mad as Picard, but it's layered with the personal pain and anguish that only a parent can feel.
 Wesley walks into view, carrying his suitcase. He sees Wakasa, whose attention is focused on something o.c.
 Wesley watches with concern as the other Cardassian Trooper is brought out of a building under the guard of Two other Indians. His weapon has also been taken. Wakasa directs the Indians to bring the Cardassians over to the front of one of the buildings.
 Where Picard and Gul Evek are listening to Worf's report.
 As before. Worf is trying to reason with Wakasa, but the tension level is steadily rising.
 Picard and Gul Evek have now moved to the Bridge and are standing near the Tactical station. Riker is at Tactical with an N.D. Officer, monitoring the situation on the planet. The ship is at RED ALERT and there is a sense of urgency in the air.
 The ship in orbit.
 Picard, Gul Evek, and Anthwara are seated at the table.
 The ship in orbit.
 Wesley is saying good-bye to Beverly and Picard. There is an N.D. Transporter Chief at the console.
 where CANDLES and other Klingon ARTIFACTS are arranged around the DIMLY LIT room. WORF, dressed in Klingon CEREMONIAL ROBES, paces back and forth, talking to himself -- he's practicing a speech.
 where PICARD, RIKER, DATA and Worf are concluding a mission briefing. Worf seems distracted, his mind elsewhere.
 as it approaches Maranga Four.
 where the festival of Kot'baval is in progress. Although there are signs of modernity, the town square has an ancient, almost medieval feel to it -- it has heavy stone walls, and little storefronts where colorful Klingon wares are sold.
 The square is now deserted and dark. We pan across a sleeping FIGURE stretched out on a bench, then find Worf sitting nearby, waiting impatiently for Alexander.
 revealing the Klingon who was staring at them before... he's standing in a shadowed doorway, watching them...
 as Worf stands and starts to cross away.
 Worf and Alexander surrounded by the three armed assailants...
 where Riker, Worf and K'mtar have met to discuss what happened. The dagger dropped in the attack is on the table, wrapped in a soft cloth. K'mtar seems a little impatient, as if he wants Riker to leave him and Worf alone.
 where Worf and K'mtar are talking. Worf is annoyed with how K'mtar treated Riker, but K'mtar is oblivious.
 as K'mtar goes to sit next to Alexander, who's tucked in under a blanket. Worf hangs back by the door. K'mtar picks up a picture of K'Ehlyer next to the bed. His attitude to Alexander is considerably less gruff.
 Riker has the Bridge, Worf is at tactical, and various N.D.s man the other consoles. Riker approaches Data and K'mtar, who are working at an aft science station.
 as Worf, K'mtar and Alexander make their way down it. Father and son are in work-out clothes, K'mtar in battle gear -- he has a knife in his belt.
 as they approach a Holodeck door.
 which is now deserted. They ENTER, and cross into the center of the square.
 at impulse.
 Data has the Bridge, Worf is at tactical, various N.D.s as needed. Riker ENTERS from the Ready Room.
 where Geordi, Data, Worf and an N.D. SECURITY OFFICER are moving through an underground TUNNEL. They carry PALM BEACONS and PHASERS.
 as they react to what they see -- a lone DOPTERIAN -- GORTA, sitting on a crate, morosely eating out of a can. He turns at the sound of their entrance, a look of surprise on his face.
 where Worf is sitting at the bar, alone. The usual compliment of N.D.s. After a moment, K'mtar approaches him -- he's had time to think about what happened.
 where Worf has just told Troi everything.
 where Alexander is listening to K'mtar recount an ancient Klingon story.
 at impulse.
 Riker and Troi in the command area. Data is at Ops, Worf at tactical.
 as a BEAM lances out from the phaser banks.
 where a shimmering EXPLOSION appears on the VIEWSCREEN; particles of shiny dust are spewn everywhere, and for a moment, the outline of a KLINGON BIRD OF PREY is visible against the shimmer.
 where Riker, Troi, Lursa, B'Etor, Worf and K'mtar have met. An N.D. Security Guard is posted at the door. The sisters refuse to sit, preferring to pace around and slam their hands on the table for emphasis. Worf places the wrapped dagger on the table in front of them.
 where Alexander is sleeping peacefully; the light that comes in through the doorway from the main room casts a shaft across his quietly breathing form.
 revealing that it is K'mtar, standing there looking down at Alexander. His features are drawn, his eyes filled with dread.
 Worf stares at him in disbelief...
 at impulse.
 as Worf ENTERS from the corridor to find Alexander in the town square, practicing moves with his BAT'LETH. He turns when he sees his father.
 RIKER, DATA and WORF are at their usual stations, along with assorted SUPERNUMERARIES. There's a feeling of urgency in the air. PICARD ENTERS from his Ready Room.
 All eyes are on Picard. He's said nothing to indicate what he thinks of Bok's claim... and no one's about to ask.
 as it hangs in space.
 where Picard is staring out his window, lost in thought. The door CHIMES.
 showing the picture of a ten year old boy.
 Picard asks a question that could confirm or disprove Bok's assertion.
 entering orbit of Camor Five...
 Picard and Riker now in the command area, Data at Aft Science, Worf at Tactical.
 Picard steps into the room, where JASON VIGO is in the process of MATERIALIZING. He is a handsome youth of about twenty-three, wearing high-tech rock climbing gear that's covered in dust. He's in the position of someone who was just scaling a rock face.
 What were you doing down in that cave? Are you a seismologist?
 where Picard has brought Jason to talk privately. Jason is walking around looking at Picard's things. He stops when he sees Picard's archaeological collection.
 Riker in the command area, Worf at Tactical. Picard is with Data and GEORDI at aft science.
 at warp.
 where Beverly is working. After a moment, Picard appears at the door. Beverly smiles and waves him in.
 where Jason is now in CIVILIAN CLOTHES. He's working on his climbing gear, wrapping and knotting ropes, etc. The door CHIMES.
 as it drops out of warp.
 where he's asleep in bed. After a moment, we hear the sound of a man's voice... soft, taunting...
 Twenty minutes later. Picard and Worf watch Geordi as he works a console.
 It is morning. Jason is getting a GLASS of ORANGE JUICE from the BARTENDER. When he crosses away, TWO SECURITY OFFICERS follow him -- a male N.D. named GARVEY, and female, LIEUTENANT RHODES.
 as it travels at impulse.
 Picard and Riker in the command area, Data at Ops, Worf at tactical. Data complete an operation on his console and turns to Riker.
 Geordi stands at the foot of Picard's bed, holding a SCANNER like the one used in "Eye of the Beholder."
 Picard lets out an exasperated breath, hating to feel this powerless. At the same time, Worf spots something on his console.
 where Picard is sitting at his desk, studying his computer screen. After a moment, he stands and crosses to the Replicator.
 Beverly is studying a readout on the main console -- a PATIENT is laid out on the center bio-bed. After a beat Beverly turns to a nearby N.D. NURSE.
 The two security officers step out of the way as Beverly and the nurse rush into the room. There, on the floor, Jason is twisting and thrashing in some kind of violent, convulsive fit.
 Jason is sitting up now, recovered but still shaken by what happened. Beverly is scanning him with a TRICORDER; Picard stands nearby, the guards at a distance.
 Geordi and Data are scanning the room -- Data has a TRICORDER, Geordi has the SCANNER that he used in Picard's quarters. Picard ENTERS from the Bridge.
 Picard approaches the entrance to the Holodeck.
 Picard finds himself standing at the base of a rockface, which Jason is scaling free-hand -- that is, without ropes or other gear.
 as Picard pulls himself on to it and catches his breath.

 Beverly is working at her desk. After a beat, Picard ENTERS -- he's in a great mood, full of energy...
 Riker has command, Data at Ops, Worf at tactical. N.D.s as needed. Riker is handing a PADD back to an N.D. after having checked something over... suddenly --
 where Picard and Beverly are still talking.
 The transporter beam is focusing on deck nine, section four.
 where Geordi is working the console.

 as Rhodes and Garvey burst into the room. Jason turns away from the replicator where he was standing --
 where Geordi is urgently working the transporter console.
 Riker in the command area, Data at Ops, Worf at Tactical. N.D's as needed. Picard ENTERS from the Turbolift; his step is urgent.
 TWO N.D. FERENGI operate the ship while Bok speaks with his captive.

 Geordi is at the wall panel, Data at the main console -- both are working urgently. Picard is on the pad with a PHASER in hand.
 where Bok is standing near Jason with the knife.
 as it orbits Camor Five.
 as Picard and Jason make their way toward the Transporter room. Jason carries a SHOULDER PACK with all his belongings in it.
 Picard nods a greeting to the N.D manning the console as he and Jason ENTER. Jason glances toward the platform, then turns to Picard.
 (Note: this is a re-dress of the Klingon outpost set from "Firstborn".) The room is dark, the walls obscured by a light fog. DATA is standing in the dim light of a single burning TORCH. He is wearing loose-fitting, ritual ROBES, and he holds a carved wooden STAFF in one hand and a large, ancient-looking BOOK in the other. The SOUND of the nearby ocean can be heard. Data's voice is solemn, incantatory.

 If I am not mistaken.
 on the ground. They look up at the train as it thunders by, catching glimpses of the car windows, the cranking, screeching wheels. The roar and clatter overwhelm any other sounds... And then suddenly it's past them... and it's gone. The room is back to way it was.
 The Holodeck DOORS OPEN and Picard and Data step out (NOTE: Data is still wearing the Prospero costume). Data notices the cut on Picard's forehead.
 Picard is sitting on a biobed as BEVERLY treats his forehead with a MEDICAL INSTRUMENT, healing the scrape as they speak.

 Picard and RIKER are at their command chairs, Data at Ops. N.D.s are at various stations. Riker hands Picard a PADD.
 GEORDI is frantically moving between consoles.
 moving at impulse.
 Picard walks up to the station where Data and Geordi are carefully studying an OKUDAGRAM on the monitor. The graphic shows the ship surrounded by a "sea" of small, intense regions of energy.
 Data and Geordi are crawling along a horizontal section of the tube.
 completely different in color and appearance from the circuitry around it.
 as Geordi and Data begin scanning the mysterious node.
 Data and Geordi are briefing Riker at the pool table. A monitor displays a GRAPHIC of the Enterprise, highlighting the locations of several connection nodes scattered throughout the ship. The connection nodes are all linked together, and the image suggests the crude beginnings of spider's web.
 Riker, Data, and WORF are standing outside the Holodeck; both Data and Worf have TRICORDERS. Data is tapping commands into the control panel.
 It's a classic Victorian salon car, decorated in the opulent, grand style of the time. There's a door at each end and the WINDOWS are covered by closed DRAPES; a SIGNAL CABLE runs along one of the walls, used by passengers to signal the engineer. The HUMMING of the rails and the CLACKETY-CLACK of the tracks can be heard as the train speeds along.
 standing in the doorway, a smoking Colt Army .45 AUTOMATIC PISTOL cradled comfortably in his hand.
 Suddenly, a console EXPLODES in a shower of sparks near Geordi, sending him reeling backwards.
 As Riker lowers the Engineer's body to the floor, The Conductor tugs the cable several times, causing several CHIMES to sound. Suddenly, the wheels SCREECH and the train LURCHES, tossing everybody to one side. With a LOUD BLAST from the train's WHISTLE, the train straightens itself again and continues forward even faster than before...
 Suddenly, the warp core -- which until now had been idle with the ship at impulse -- comes to life and begins to PULSE... the SHIP LURCHES FORWARD.
 The Conductor reaches into the Engineer's bib and withdraws a BRICK OF GOLD. He looks at it, pleased.
 Riker, Data and Geordi are gathered around the pool table. A monitor GRAPHIC displays the connection nodes throughout the ship; compared to the previous graphic, the number of nodes has increased dramatically, and the Data is studying it with keen interest.
 at warp.
 Data is standing at the wall monitor, briefing Picard, Riker, Beverly, TROI, Geordi, and Worf. The monitor displays a GRAPHIC of THREE SEPARATE IMAGES.
 Troi, Data, and Worf ENTER from the rear door. Data is carrying a small SCANNING DEVICE. They hear a loud CLANG... CLANG... CLANG... and turn toward it...
 One of the Flappers is attempting to give the Knight a drink from a beautiful CHALICE... but she keeps banging it against his visor. CLANG... CLANG... CLANG.

 Worf has joined Data, who is kneeling on the floor with his device.
 He suddenly stands up, grabs the brick.

 Troi, Data, and Worf emerge from the subway, walking up the stairs into the middle of the street. The place is completely deserted.
 as he carefully scans the street. He stops at a MANHOLE COVER in the middle of the intersection.
 revealing a HIGH-TECH INTERFACE underneath. The border shows the yellow lines of the Holodeck grid.
 as Data bends down and begins to hook his device into the interface.
 as he moves furtively out of sight around a corner.
 There he is. I'm going after him.
 It's the front of an apartment building. The MAIN DOOR is surrounded by SCAFFOLDING -- it's been almost entirely bricked-in, and there's a PILE OF BRICKS on the ground in front of it. It's a strangely incongruous site on this nice, finished residential block.
 For a moment, the brick GLOWS brightly with a strange, unearthly light... when the glow fades, the gold brick is no longer visible -- the face of the brick wall is one continuous whole... it's complete.
 Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a train to catch.
 The ship is at RED ALERT. Geordi is working the console as Picard watches with concern.
 Geordi ENTERS with TWO N.D. STARFLEET OFFICERS -- and they immediately see an incredible sight.
 on the floor, GLOWING. It is solid and semitransparent, a tiny shape, not unlike one of the sections of the molecular image we've been seeing.
 Troi and Worf are still examining the brick wall, trying to understand what just happened.
 I encountered a minor difficulty, Counselor...
 Data is working with only one of his hands in the manhole -- his other hand is holding the front bumper of the taxi, which is spinning its wheels in a futile attempt to run him over.
 Geordi and his team are scanning the mysterious object on the ground, which is still in the process of MATERIALIZING.
 The tremble has grown into a violent SHAKING. Troi and Worf glance around in concern.
 Data is still at the manhole with his device.
 Data... I think we should get together and compare notes.
 Troi on the biobed, Beverly treating her, Geordi and Picard nearby.
 Troi, Data, and Worf ENTER. The Conductor marches up the aisle, angry.
 There is a coal-fired BOILER and a CONTROL BOX with several gears and levers. The Conductor hands Worf a shovel and opens the boiler door. He gestures off-camera.
 Picard and Riker. Riker is studying his chair console.
 The train is ROARING along faster than ever. Worf is shoveling coal into the boiler; the Conductor acts as cheerleader.
 as it nears a WHITE STAR, a BEAM shoots forth from the ship into the star.
 Riker reacts to his console.
 Geordi and his team are standing near the object, scanning it with their tricorders. The object is beginning to GLOW BRIGHTLY FROM WITHIN. It is now much larger than before and clearly resembles the strange molecule we've seen before...
 The Conductor's checking the boiler, panicking...
 The particle beam BREAKS UP completely and DISAPPEARS...
 The GLOW from the object FADES and DARKENS. The nearly finished "molecule" now appears inert...
 The Conductor moves to the controls, grabs a lever.
 With an awful SCREECH OF THE TRACKS, the train lurches from side to side -- Troi, Data and the other passengers are thrown about in the terrible grinding, CRASH. The train has DERAILED. Everything goes black...
 hanging in space at an extreme angle -- as if It's a smoking wreck inside, and the train has come to a complete stop. Data and Troi struggle to their feet -- Troi is battered and bruised but okay. As they try to get their bearings, Worf ENTERS from the forward door.
 Are you all right?
 Picard and Riker have joined Geordi in the Cargo Bay. Geordi is running his tricorder over the now DIMLY-FLICKERING Object.
 Troi, Data, and Worf look around in amazement: the room has returned to normal. All of the passengers are there (except the Conductor, the Hitman, and the Engineer), and everyone seems happy as the train speeds along.
 Picard and Riker are in their command positions; Geordi is studying the Aft Science console in the background.
 The three confer.

 The monitor is displaying a STAR MAP as Geordi works the console. Picard and Riker stand nearby, watching.
 Troi, Data, and Worf with the group on the train. Troi is trying to communicate with the Hayseed.
 Data ENTERS to see the Conductor and the Hitman standing in front of the brake lever and control box. The Hitman has drawn his gun. The boiler is burning brightly behind them.
 Picard and Riker at command; Geordi at Aft Science.

 Are the torpedo modifications complete?
 blasts into the Nebula... a short beat later, the Nebula explodes into a dazzling, shimmering GLOW.
 It's working, sir... the reaction's producing vertion particles...
 Both the Conductor and the Hitman are looking curiously out the window as Data watches them carefully.
 A particle BEAM from the ship is tapping into the glowing NEBULA.
 Picard, Beverly, and Geordi are watching the Object -- it's almost fully formed now, and is GLOWING with a strong, powerful radiance. As they look at the forming Object in wonder, Riker ENTERS and moves to Picard.
 and REMATERIALIZES outside the ship. Then the Object moves gently away and disappears into space.
 All the characters we've seen are in the car, champagne glasses in hand, raised for a toast. Troi, Data and Worf have joined them.
 Worf, Troi and Data are standing in an empty Holodeck. OFF their expressions...
 The ship at impulse across a field of stars.
 Picard is working at his computer when the door CHIMES.
 as it travels at impulse.
 where a reception is in progress for RO LAREN -- there's a buffet table, drinks, and some quiet music in the background.
 Ro sees him walking out of Ten Forward -- the one person she might have wanted to spend time with.
 Where the conversation is at a bit of a standstill.
 where she's surprised to find Picard standing there waiting for her with a faint smile on his face.
 where Riker has the Bridge. N.D.s as needed.
 Change course to intercept -- I'm on my way. I'd like you at the Conn, Lieutenant.
 as Picard and Ro ENTER from the Turbolift and take their positions. We're at red alert. WORF is at Tactical, DATA at Ops.

 We're coming into visual range.
 as the torpedoes shoot out from the ship's hull.
 Two Maquis ships are in frame, flying in formation. Suddenly a photon burst dead ahead causes them to veer sharply away and scatter.
 The Maquis are breaking formation -- they are withdrawing.

 A seedy joint on some planet in the Demilitarized Zone. Its patrons are a motley mix -- humans, Bajorans, and a few Aliens.
 where Ro is unconscious, laid out on a bench.
 as Ro and Macias walk through the central square. Again, this is a "frontier town" -- it has a rough-hewn quality, although there is evidence of Federation technology.
 Camera MOVES through the square as the citizens go about their business on a typical day. It's warm and sunny, and people seem to be in a good mood. Camera FINDS Ro sitting in the sun, a half-eaten hasperat roll at her side. Santos approaches her.
 Macias, Kalita and several others are there, including a Native American. Santos and Ro ENTER.
 a Maquis ship traveling at impulse.
 where we find Kalita sitting in the cockpit -- the ship is on auto-pilot. Ro is working on a PANEL in the rear of the ship. There's a heavy silence between them -- Kalita is not only suspicious of Ro, she's skeptical that she can do what she promised. After a moment, Ro finishes working... as she crosses forward toward the cockpit --
 as it hangs in space.
 Riker has the Bridge, Data at Ops, Worf at Tactical, N.D's as needed. Picard ENTERS from the Ready Room.
 where the Maquis ship hangs motionless. In the b.g. we can see the distinctive STAR of the Topin system.
 where Ro and Kalita are waiting. Again, a silence hangs between them.
 Picard, Riker, Data and Worf as before.
 Ro and Kalita as before.

 as Ro works her controls. We see her react to something she sees -- a small smile... Picard must have gotten her message. For Kalita's sake, she plays it through.

 Picard and Worf are at an aft station with Data, looking at a sensor readout on a MONITOR. The readout shows a section of space on a grid -- on the left edge we see the nebula, and in the center, the convoy, depicted as a series of blips. Along the right side a line demarcates the border of the DMZ.
 a squadron of Maquis ships flying in formation at impulse.
 Riker and Ro are silent as they pilot the ship for a beat. She's about to betray a group of people she's come to care about and she feels awful about it.

 as they work their controls.
 where Picard is standing with Data looking at the aft station monitor.
 where a frustrated Riker glares at a determined Ro.
 as he reacts to his console.
 Sir, the Maquis ships are breaking formation.
 Ro works the controls for a few beats, careful to keep the phaser trained on Riker. Finally she finishes and stands, avoiding Riker's gaze.
 as it moves at impulse through a starfield.
 where Riker has just told Picard everything.
 WORF and TROI ENTER from the Holodeck doors. They are dressed in casual clothing -- it's late, and the mood is light and intimate. Troi is smiling, and even Worf is happy -- it's clear they had a great time, wherever they were.
 Worf and Troi walking towards her quarters.
 It was more than a dream... the smells and the sounds... the way things felt to the touch... it was all so real...
 We are now twenty-five years in the future. Picard is an OLD MAN, wearing civilian clothes and a hat to protect himself from the sun. He has a beard and longer hair. (But he should not look as old as he did at the end of "The Inner Light".) He is kneeling in a row of grape vines at his home in France (as seen in He is reaching out for a vine with the same hand and in the same manner that we just saw him hold out his cup in Troi's quarters. As his hand closes around the vine, he hesitates. He seems disoriented, confused for a moment, just as he described to Troi. He looks around the vineyard in puzzlement. But the moment passes, and he accepts this time as the present.
 revealing GEORDI walking toward Picard. He is wearing civilian clothes and he has also aged twenty-five years. His VISOR is gone and has been replaced by ARTIFICIAL EYES, which have a distinctive electronic look to them. Geordi is smiling broadly.
 Standing in the vineyards are THREE scraggly-looking HUMANS. They point at Picard, shouting and jeering.
 He reacts to this strange sight in the vineyard.
 Geordi follows Picard's look, but sees nothing. Picard is mystified -- what's going on? We MOVE IN on Picard.
 Picard is sitting in the co-pilot's seat, wearing his OLD-STYLE UNIFORM as seen in the first season. TASHA YAR is sitting next to him. She looks exactly as she did in the series pilot.
 Through the windows of the shuttle we can see the ENTERPRISE sitting in its dock above Earth.
 As soon as Picard sees the ship, his feeling of disorientation is forgotten, and he can't help but smile at the beautiful sight. PULL BACK TO REVEAL WE ARE NOW IN:
 Picard still smiling, staring, holding a cup of tea half-way to his mouth. (NOTE: We will no longer be using the convention of Picard returning to the exact moment he left.) Troi looks at him oddly.
 Later. Picard is sitting on a bio-bed, still wearing his bathrobe. BEVERLY is finishing a scan.
 Picard ENTERS, sits down at the desk and activates the desktop monitor. After a beat, ADMIRAL NAKAMURA appears on the screen.
 In the same motion, the older Picard rises to his feet -- and in doing so, stumbles and nearly falls. Geordi grabs him by the arm, tries to help him up.
 revealing SIX scraggly HUMANS standing nearby around Picard and Geordi. They are jeering and pointing at Picard, as seen earlier. Picard looks at them in shock.
 No one is there.
 See... who?
 who looks at Geordi, then looks back out at the vineyard. When he looks out, the humans are gone.
 A spacious and very comfortable room. The walls are lined with books. There is a FIRE roaring in the hearth. And there are about ten CATS wandering about or sleeping. (The mood and feel should remind us of the Sherlock Homes Drawing Room set.)
 Picard is JUMPING out of the shuttlecraft, which is now sitting in the middle of the bay. Picard hesitates for a moment, disoriented at first. A large group of CREWMEMBERS are lined up in several ranks next to the shuttle standing at ease. Visible at the front of the group are Troi, O'BRIEN and Worf -- all are wearing the uniforms and "look" of "Encounter at Farpoint". Tasha steps out behind Picard and calls out in a loud voice:
 We can now see three of the scraggly HUMANS standing on the catwalk. They are laughing at Picard.
 He reacts in surprise...
 The figures are gone.
 Picard hesitates, jarred by the strange apparition... then recovers and continues reading from the PADD...
 There are now six scraggly humans standing on the catwalk, laughing and jeering.
 looks away from the crowd, tries to concentrate on what he's doing. There's an awkward silence. Tasha gives him a slightly puzzled look -- what's wrong with him? Picard clears his throat and then continues...
 reacts.
 The humans are gone.
 takes a beat, then makes a decision --
 Picard is staring out the windows as the crew of the past is filing in -- Tasha, Worf, Troi. The room appears as it did in the FIRST SEASON, complete with gold ship models on the wall. Camera should FAVOR Tasha, to orient us that we're in the past.
 Picard, Worf, Tasha and Troi ENTER. Chief O'Brien is standing down in the command area. He hands a PADD to Picard. There are N.D. crewmembers milling about on the Bridge, working at opened panels... moving portable equipment around, etc. The ship is a mess -- clearly, not ready for space travel yet.
 Picard is in Geordi's office, sitting at a console, O'Brien standing next to him watching as the Captain rapidly works the console. Several N.D.s are working at various opened consoles and panels -- they're getting the ship ready to go.
 Picard standing in his bathrobe near the desk. Beverly and Riker are standing in the doorway, looking at him, puzzled. Picard is momentarily disoriented -- tries to orient himself to the here and now.
 Picard, Riker, Worf, Data, Troi, Geordi, Beverly. Midconversation.
 Riker ENTERS. Beverly is standing near the aft console, watching Picard as he gives Data orders. The ship is at Yellow Alert.
 She watches Picard exit, a look of concern on her face. OFF her expression...
 Picard sitting at his desk. The door CHIMES.
 Geordi is gently waking Picard, who is sleeping on Data's sofa. Picard blinks open his eyes.
 As seen earlier.
 A short time later. Where the hearth and fire were seen earlier there is now a large VIEWSCREEN and a computer console. Picard is talking to Admiral Riker on the viewer.
 A small and sleek VESSEL with the 24th century equivalent of "Red Cross" markings. The ship is orbiting Earth.
 The Bridge of a futuristic medical ship. Picard, Geordi and Data (who's now dressed in travel clothes) ENTER from a Turbolift. ENSIGN CHILTON is at the Conn. Someone is sitting in the Captain's chair and is turned away from them. The chair swivels to face them and we REVEAL --
 Picard standing in the moving Lift.
 Picard walking out of a Turbolift onto the Bridge. He hesitates only for a moment, quickly orienting himself. He moves to the Command Area. Tasha, Worf, O'Brien, Data and Troi at their stations.
 What is a... "Q"?
 is getting more and more frustrated.
 As Picard steps through the doors, the SCENE CHANGES TO:
 Picard is suddenly in front of the screaming crowd, as seen in "Farpoint". The crowd is looking down the hallway that leads into the courtroom. Out of the darkness, riding on his FLOATING CHAIR -- Q appears, dressed in his judge's robes. The crowd ROARS in approval at the sight of him. Q holds up a hand and they fall silent. He looks toward Picard.
 Picard facing Q, as before.
 Picard sits up on the couch suddenly, the SOUND of the gong slowly fading away. He realizes what's happened.
 Picard steps onto the Bridge and addresses Riker.
 at warp.
 Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, Geordi, Beverly, Troi. Midconversation.
 Picard, Riker, Data and Worf ENTER and move to their positions. Beverly, Geordi and Troi EXIT to the Turbolift. The ship is still at Red Alert.
 The image of an aged Worf appears on the viewer.
 The older Picard is standing next to the Captain's chair. Beverly and Chilton are at their stations. Data and Geordi look on. Picard blinks for a moment, steadies himself against Beverly's chair as he adjusts to the abrupt time shift.
 Picard sitting in the Captain's chair, hand raised.
 Picard and Troi ENTER.
 The image of YOUNG WIL RIKER appears.
 In the b.g., we can see that Troi reacts to the sight of Riker on the monitor.
 Understood.
 Picard turns to Troi.
 Picard standing in front of the Viewscreen. TOMALAK, the Romulan Commander, is on the viewer.
 The ship at warp.
 A short time later.
 As Data's HANDS work the console. MOVE TO REVEAL WE'RE IN:
 Data is working his console, O'Brien is at Conn.
 Another angle. Picard glances around, orienting himself. Beverly in Command, Chilton at Conn, Data and Geordi are working at an aft console. Worf is looking on.
 Nothing but the starfield.
 As you can see, sir -- there's nothing there.
 A few minutes later. Beverly looking over Data's shoulder at the aft science station. Picard nearby. Chilton at Con. Worf is working at nearby console. Geordi looking on.
 Beverly and Picard ENTER.
 Picard standing near the Ops station, leaning on the same cane we just saw in Q's hand. Riker and Worf at stations. Picard glances at the cane and tosses it aside.
 Later. Data and Geordi working at consoles.
 A thin, oscillating BEAM emits from the deflector dish and begins SCANNING the anomaly.
 As before. Data and Geordi watch the monitors.
 A while later. Geordi sitting on a bio-bed with his VISOR off.
 Who is sitting in his chair at Ops, looking confused.
 Picard is standing on the Bridge, talking to Data. Picard quickly moves to Data's console and begins entering information rapidly. Tasha, Worf, O'Brien and Troi at their stations.
 Which now shows a Terrellian pilot named ANDRONA.
 Picard is moving briskly toward the door. The ship suddenly SHAKES and Picard is nearly knocked off his feet. The ship goes to RED ALERT and Picard heads for the Bridge.
 Beverly in command, Chilton at Conn. Worf, Data, and Geordi working aft consoles. Picard ENTERS from the Ready Room.
 The Pasteur is surrounded by TWO KLINGON ATTACK CRUISERS.
 As before, ship at Red Alert. The ship is ROCKED again.
 The Pasteur is trying to get away from the two Klingon attack cruisers, which continue to fire on the medical ship.
 The ship is ROCKED more violently.
 Suddenly, the ENTERPRISE-D DE-CLOAKS -- the ship is travelling vertically. FOLLOW it as it swoops up towards the medical ship and the two Klingon attack cruisers.
 They're hailing us.
 The Enterprise FIRES on the attack cruisers with a furious volley of PHASERS and TORPEDOES. One of the Klingon ships EXPLODES.
 As before. The shaking has STOPPED.
 Riker in command, Gaines at Tactical. The Enterprise has seen a few technological updates over the years. The Captain's chair is now slightly higher than it used to be, and there are other changes in evidence. Picard, Beverly, Worf, Data, Geordi and other N.D.s from the Pasteur MATERIALIZE on Bridge.
 The Enterprise backs away from the Pasteur. After a beat, the medical ship EXPLODES.
 Everyone reacts.
 Picard nearly bumps into a crewman as he turns a corner. He hesitates for a moment, then continues walking towards Sickbay...
 Picard ENTERS. Beverly is tending to Ogawa, who is lying on a bio-bed. Ogawa is wearing a patient's gown and no longer appears to be pregnant. She looks distraught -- she's been crying. Ogawa's N.D. HUSBAND is standing by her, holding her hand, trying to comfort her. Geordi is in the b.g., lying on another bio-bed.
 The ship holding position near the ANOMALY. We can still see the ENERGY BEAM scanning the anomaly.
 Picard, Data, Riker, and Troi at the table. This is the end of a staff meeting.
 Picard and Q are standing on a craggy ledge overlooking a vast expanse of LAVA, VOLCANIC GASES and CHURNING SEAS. Picard reacts, looks around for a moment. (NOTE: Picard still in present-day uniform; Q in his Starfleet uniform).
 Instead of a starfield, the sky is FILLED with the SPATIAL ANOMALY seen throughout the show. But here it is HUGE -- filling the entire sky from horizon to horizon.
 Picard reacts.
 Picard in command. Off his reaction...
 Picard, Tasha, Worf, Data and O'Brien at their stations. Troi ENTERS, looking very concerned.
 The ship near the LARGE ANOMALY. The tachyon pulse is scanning the anomaly.
 Picard, O'Brien and Data working at the pool table.
 A graphic showing various sensor information. CUT TO REVEAL WE'RE IN:
 Old Picard suddenly sits up in bed. He's wearing nightclothes. He looks around the room for a moment, orienting himself. He gets out of bed, taps a control on a nearby table.
 Riker, Beverly, Geordi and Data are at a table. Worf is sitting alone at a separate table on the other side of the room. Mid-conversation.
 Picard is walking through the ship with a slightly confused expression. He pauses at an intersection... isn't sure which way to go... he's drawing curious looks from passing crewmembers... Picard finally chooses a direction and goes down the Corridor. He stops outside a set of doors and then OPENS them. We can see the Transporter Room inside. Picard stops... turns and looks panicked and despairing... he's lost on his own ship.
 Riker, Beverly, Data, and Geordi at their table as before. Beverly suddenly reacts to something offcamera.
 coming out of warp.
 Riker, Picard, Beverly, Data, Worf, Geordi, Gaines. Gaines at tactical, N.D.s man the other stations. Data and Geordi at aft stations. Picard is back in his travel clothes.
 Picard MOVING toward Geordi and Data at the aft consoles, as in Act Nine. (Note: Picard is at different locations in all three time periods, allowing for straight-cut transitions during the fast pace of Act Ten.)
 The ship holding position at the anomaly. We see the tachyon beam TURN OFF.
 As before.

 Picard in command. Data, Tasha, Worf, Troi, O'Brien at their stations.
 Picard sitting in the command chair. Everyone else as seen before.
 Picard finishing his sentence --
 Picard at aft console command -- everything as before. Data turns to him from the aft console.
 As before.
 The ship begins moving towards the anomaly... closer... closer...
 As before. Tense. The crew is watching the ANOMALY on the Viewscreen -- it's getting closer.
 The ship is ROCKING. The anomaly has almost FILLED the Viewscreen. Lights flickering on and off here, as well. People hanging on.
 The ship is SHAKING.
 As before -- the ship SHAKING.
 As before -- the ship SHAKING.
 As before -- ship SHAKING.
 As before -- shaking.
 which is filled with the roiling anomaly. But faintly through the energy, we can see the GHOSTLY IMAGES of TWO ENTERPRISES. The ships are drifting in the anomaly very close to each other -- in fact, they appear to be moving through each other. It's a startling sight.
 The crew watching the exact same image on their Viewscreen -- two Enterprises.
 This crew watching the same image on their Viewscreen, It's an awesome moment.
 As before.
 On the Viewscreen, one of the ghostly Enterprises EXPLODES -- destroyed. Reactions.
 As before -- shaking out of control. On the Viewscreen, we see the second Enterprise EXPLODE. Reactions to the sight.
 The anomaly COLLAPSES INWARD on top of the Enterprise -- the SCREEN WHITES OUT --
 Silence. Picard standing alone in a now empty courtroom. He's dressed normally, present-day age. Picard is a little disoriented by the sudden silence. After a moment, Q's floating chair drops down into frame. Q is dressed in his Judge's robes again. He studies Picard.
 Picard stepping out of the Turbolift, dressed in his bathrobe. Troi and Worf are standing there, looking at him in surprise. We are back at the exact same moment we saw in the Teaser. Picard stares at them, then looks down at himself, sees his bathrobe...
 at impulse.
 Riker, Data, Beverly, Troi and Geordi sitting at the table, playing POKER. Troi is raking in her winnings with a big smile. Beverly pushes back her chair and gets up.
 The great ship moving off into the distance...
